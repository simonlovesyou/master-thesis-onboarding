abstract = {Gaining an understanding of unfamiliar software systems is hard. Existing support tools are based on studies of the information sought by software developers, but often the developers themselves do not know what to look for. Here an alternative is proposed: by studying the information `pushed' from software experts to new developers during onboarding, the information provided by the experts can be analysed and compared to the information `pulled' by the new developers. The content and presentation of this data will inform tool design for onboarding support.},

abstract = {Novel applications of website interactivity are important to attract and retain online users. In this empirical study five designs for interactivity are examined using different web-poll interfaces. The goal of the investigation is to examine perceived interactivity in a model which includes most commonly tested cognitive elements such as efficiency and effectiveness, but augments this model with the inclusion of a cognitive–affective element for trust, and an affective element of enjoyment. More specifically, a model is created to validate the relationship of perceived interactivity (comprised of user control, user connectedness, and responsiveness of the web-poll application) to efficiency, effectiveness, trust and enjoyment, of the website. In turn, efficiency, effectiveness, trust, and enjoyment are tested for their influence on user behavioral intentions for e-loyalty. All relationships in the model are supported. In addition, exploratory evaluation of qualitative comments is conducted to investigate additional insights between the five web-poll treatments in this investigation. The research confirms the complexity of a model in which cognitive, cognitive–affective and affective elements are present, and advances knowledge on the consequences of perceived interactivity. In additional to theoretical advancements, the research has merit for web designers and online marketers regarding how to enhance interactive online web applications.},

abstract = {The transition to college is a difficult time for most students. Students experience changes in interpersonal and social adjustment, academic and career concerns, as well as personal change (Bishop, Gallagher, {\&} Cohen, 2000). For adult learners this transition can be further complicated by working full-time and family responsibilities. Thus, failure of any student to not successfully adjust and acclimate into his or her new college community can greatly affect the student's persistence and academic success (Tinto, 1993). While most colleges offer a short term in-person orientation to help new traditional-aged students integrate into a college campus, adult students are often left without an option. Though, an alternative method of orienting, acclimating, and supporting adult learners might be realized through the use of virtual and Web 2.0 technologies. Through this method, college staff and faculty members can onboard adult students to campus by virtually interacting, advising, communicating, and supporting them. Additionally, a virtual onboarding program can encourage adults to socialize with their peers and be acclimated to campus support services and offices, in an effort to increase a student's social integration and interaction, academic preparation and success, and college adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract = {In teaching theoretical topics, modern STEM education uses interactive hands-on approaches, which support students in understanding the topic instead of teaching them simply how to memorize theoretical concepts. Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.},

Network Services operators have a critical need to establish and execute a business strategy that leverages their own particular operating strengths in combination with the application and service innovations thriving in the internet marketplace. They recognize that to support new applications and services they need to change the way they plan and deliver services to end customers and partners. In this paper we focus on the applications onboarding planning aspects of the enablement strategy and explore two key questions: (i) what operations changes are required to support the possible variations in enablement strategy, and (ii) how can those operations changes be defined and evaluated for speed to market and cost impact.},

When presenting the different elements of onboarding the authors mix competitor analysis with unreferenced claims about best practices. The methodology of the paper is hard to define; the authors evaluate 6 major MOOC providers without discussing how they analyse them, and make claims that none of the tested MOOC providers have a "smooth" onboarding experience. The suggested improvements to the onboarding process does not target specific problems they have found in the analysis, instead they target larger onboarding concepts. The study has not been an objective one; most of their claims about best practices are unsupported. Their "insights" about the users of MOOCs are unsupported and the language and spelling errors does not persuave the reader. The final value for the reader are some of the targeted areas, that still require additional references and sources, and that providing a good onboarding user experience is difficult.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the onboarding phase for students who are exposed to a blended and open learning environment for the first time, where self-directed learning is key to succe{\ss}. The study was undertaken in a very restricted environment, where the primary motivation of students is the achievement of good grades in the most efficient manner due to extreme time constraints. In past research, we have shown that students have difficulty to move from the traditional setting of frontal lecture and final exam to an open learning environment that focuses more on self-directed learning and peer created content than grades. This work builds on findings that blended learning environment should be adaptive to learner types and gamification features need to be implicit. Adaptivity is not guaranteed through a single platform but instead by involving students in constructing their learning environment. This paper reports on the final set up of the course andthe student evaluation thereof. We show that the current environment with student involvement leads to mostly positive attitudes towards most aspects of the course acro{\ss} virtually all students. Forums are perceived as a barrier as are individual contributions to the cla{\ss} content and are not appropriate features for onboarding. In contrast and despite being difficult, effective use of peer reviews can be shown to match student motivation acro{\ss} all learners. Their use is understood as a means to obtaining a good grade and learning.},
