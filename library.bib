abstract = {In this volume, the authors begin by defining usability, advocating and explaining the methods of usability engineering and reviewing many techniques for assessing and assuring usability throughout the development process. They then follow all the steps in planning and conducting a usability test, analyzing data, and using the results to improve both products and processes. This book is simply written and filled with examples from many types of products and tests. It discusses the full range of testing options from quick studies with a few subjects to more formal tests with carefully designed controls. The authors discuss the place of usability laboratories in testing as well as the skills needed to conduct a test. Included are forms to use or modify to conduct a usability test, as well as layouts of existing labs that will help the reader build his or her own.},

abstract = {Intrinsic and extrinsic types of motivation have been widely studied, and the distinction between them has shed important light on both developmental and educa-tional practices. In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motiva-tion remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, compe-tence and relatedness are discussed.},

abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

abstract = {With the continually increasing complexity of e-learning environments, there is a need for integrating concepts of cognitive load theory (CLT) with concepts of human-computer interaction (HCI). Basic concepts of both fields were reviewed and contrasted. A literature review was conducted within the literature database "The Guide to Computing Literature," searching for "cognitive load theory" and "Sweller." Sixty-five publications contained "cognitive load" in their titles or abstracts. Each publication was checked to see whether it contained the concepts of intrinsic, extraneous, or germane cognitive load. The review showed that CLT concepts have been adopted in HCI. However, the concept of germane cognitive load has attracted less attention up to the present time. Two conceptual models are proposed. The first model divides extraneous cognitive load into load induced by the instructional design and load caused by software usage. The model clarifies the focus of traditional usability principles and of existing instructional design principles derived from CLT. The second model fits CLT concepts into the basic components of user-centered design. The concept of germane cognitive load illustrates that an increase of cognitive load can be desirable when designing e-learning environments. Areas for future interdisciplinary research are sketched. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Chau1996,
abstract = {The technology acceptance model (TAM) is one of the most influential research models in studies of the determinants of information systems/information technology (IS/IT) acceptance. In TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are hypothesized and empirically supported as fundamental determinants of user acceptance of a given IS/IT. A review of the IS and psychology literature, however, suggests that perceived usefulness can be of two distinct types: near-term usefulness and long-term usefulness. This paper reviews the concept of perceived usefulness and modifies TAM to include the two types of perceived usefulness. Data collected from nearly 285 administrative/clerical staff in a large organization were tested against the modified model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results of the study showed that, even though perceived near-term usefulness had the most significant influence on the behavioral intention to use a technology, perceived long-term usefulness also exerted a positive, though lesser, impact. No significant, direct relationship was found between ease of use and behavioral intention to use a technology. Implications of the findings and future research areas are discussed.

In this model (FBM), behavior is a product of three factors: motivation, ability, and triggers, each of which has subcomponents. The FBM asserts that for a person to perform a target behavior, he or she must (1) be sufficiently motivated, (2) have the ability to perform the behavior, and (3) be triggered to perform the behavior. These three factors must occur at the same moment, else the behavior will not happen. The FBM is useful in analysis and design of persuasive technologies. The FBM also helps teams work together efficiently because this model gives people a shared way of thinking about behavior change.},

abstract = {User experience (UX) consists of all aspects of interactions between a user and a product. Recently, many studies have been conducted to define the UX concept, but few studies have attempted to quantify UX. This paper proposed quantification models that integrate major elements of UX into a single index. A variety of models were proposed and evaluated including compensatory (i.e. simple linear, polynomial and S-shaped value) and non-compensatory (i.e. conjunctive and disjunctive) models. A case study with a commercial tablet PC was conducted in which a total of 26 subjects participated in a laboratory environment. Each participant performed a pretest ensuring the ability to make ratio judgments and then evaluated predefined dimensions with the modified magnitude estimation procedure. A total of 22 hierarchical dimensions were evaluated such as overall UX, its elements (i.e. usability, affect and user value) and sub-elements. Both compensatory and non-compensatory models had high performance in terms of goodness of fit. The results of this study are expected to help product or service designers develop indices representing an overall UX value. Relevance to industry: This study proposed quantification models that aggregate elements of UX. Although the UX index has been controversial, the single value developed by the models can be expected to help decision-makers understand about products or services intuitively. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper we argue that well-designed feedback and progress indicators (FPIs) offer guidance and structure that may encourage mobile app users to move from fragmented learning episodes towards a longer term, reflective learning journey. Drawing from relevant literature we consider how FPIs can be used in the EU-funded MASELTOV project which explores how a suite of smartphone apps can support recent immigrants to Europe to become integrated in their new cities. These apps allow learning episodes to be part of daily activities and interactions. The authors discuss what kinds of FPIs should be provided and introduce the SCAMP model which emphasises five types of FPIs- Social, Cognitive, Affective, Motivational and Progress. Finally, the authors provide examples of FPIs that will be used in the MASELTOV project. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Most respondents agree that UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective. With respect to the more controversial issues, the authors propose to delineate UX as something individual (instead of social) that emerges from interacting with a product, system, service or an object. The draft ISO definition on UX seems to be in line with the survey findings, although the issues of experiencing anticipated use and the object of UX will require further explication.

Viewing the use of technology as a process of enactment enables a deeper understanding of the constitutive role of social practices in the ongoing use and change of technologies in the workplace.

abstract = {Context plays a critical role in the user experience (UX) of mobile products. In UX studies, context is often seen as a single entity such as mobile context or car context. More fine-grained categorization of contextual factors is needed when we want to understand how context affects user experience. The purpose of our study was to adapt existing context and experience categorizations, and try out in practice how well these are suited for analyzing the user experience of mobile products. We conducted a ten-day field study where 21 participants reported their experiences of personal mobile products by writing experience reports. The reports were analyzed by using eight context categories to identify the contextual factors. Among these factors we determined the triggering context, which has the major influence on the most meaningful user experience described in a report. Our results show that having a detailed categorization for analyzing contextual factors is valuable for understanding how context affects user experience. This becomes practical in identifying the most meaningful user experiences among the reported ones. We propose that triggering context analysis should become a part of user experience studies of mobile products.},

abstract = {Organizational socialization, or onboarding, is a process through which new employees move from being organizational outsiders to becoming organizational insiders. Onboarding refers to the process that helps new employees learn the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they need to succeed in their new organizations. This process of learning to become an effective organizational member is different from occupational socialization, which focuses on learning the norms of one's profession, such as police officer, scientist, or medical professional. Organizational socialization is influenced by newcomer characteristics and behaviors, as well as by organizational efforts. Newcomer adjustment is associated with important employee and organizational outcomes such as satisfaction, commitment, turnover, and performance. In the past 3 decades, our understanding of a newcomer's adjustment to organizations increased substantially. As employees change jobs more frequently and the cost of replacing an employee increases, understanding and managing the process of socialization will provide competitive advantages to organizations.},

abstract = {Few studies in technology acceptance have explicitly addressed the acceptance of replacement technologies, technologies that replace legacy ones that have been in use. This article explores this issue through the theoretical lens of mental models. We contend that accepting replacement technologies entails both mental model maintenance and mental model building: mental model maintenance enables users to apply their knowledge of the legacy technologies, and mental model building helps users acquire new knowledge and reform their understanding to use replacement technologies. Both processes affect user perceptions about replacement technologies, which in turn affect user intentions to use them. In addition, this study explores how perceived compatibility between replacement and legacy technologies affects both mental model processes. A research model was developed and empirically tested with survey data. The results in general support our arguments. Based on the findings, we offer a few suggestions that can promote user acceptance of replacement technologies.},

Based on the Affect–Behavior–Cognition model (ABC model) of attitudes, we developed a model involving perceived value and social influences. The model is then empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 485 users regarding their perception of mobile apps. The findings indicate that stickiness and social identification significantly influence a user's intention to make in-app purchases. Specifically, significant differences were found between users and potential users in terms of antecedents to forming stickiness and making in-app purchases. The results may provide further insights into the development of effective mobile app business models and adoption strategies.},

abstract = {The usefulness of mobile devices has increased greatly in recent years allowing users to perform more tasks in a mobile context. This increase in usefulness has come at the expense of the usability of these devices in some contexts. We conducted a small review of mobile usability models and found that usability is usually measured in terms of three attributes; effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Other attributes, such as cognitive load, tend to be overlooked in the usability models that are most prominent despite their likely impact on the success or failure of an application. To remedy this we introduces the PACMAD (People At the Centre of Mobile Application Development) usability model which was designed to address the limitations of existing usability models when applied to mobile devices. PACMAD brings together significant attributes from different usability models in order to create a more comprehensive model. None of the attributes that it includes are new, but the existing prominent usability models ignore one or more of them. This could lead to an incomplete usability evaluation. We performed a literature search to compile a collection of studies that evaluate mobile applications and then evaluated the studies using our model. .},

To address this issue, we present the results of a guessability study that elicits end-user motion gestures to invoke commands on a smartphone device. We demonstrate that consensus exists among our participants on parameters of movement and on mappings of motion gestures onto commands. We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set. We highlight the implications of this work to the design of smartphone applications and hardware. Finally, we argue that our results influence best practices in design for all gestural interfaces.},

abstract = {Novel applications of website interactivity are important to attract and retain online users. In this empirical study five designs for interactivity are examined using different web-poll interfaces. The goal of the investigation is to examine perceived interactivity in a model which includes most commonly tested cognitive elements such as efficiency and effectiveness, but augments this model with the inclusion of a cognitive–affective element for trust, and an affective element of enjoyment. More specifically, a model is created to validate the relationship of perceived interactivity (comprised of user control, user connectedness, and responsiveness of the web-poll application) to efficiency, effectiveness, trust and enjoyment, of the website. In turn, efficiency, effectiveness, trust, and enjoyment are tested for their influence on user behavioral intentions for e-loyalty. All relationships in the model are supported. In addition, exploratory evaluation of qualitative comments is conducted to investigate additional insights between the five web-poll treatments in this investigation. The research confirms the complexity of a model in which cognitive, cognitive–affective and affective elements are present, and advances knowledge on the consequences of perceived interactivity. In additional to theoretical advancements, the research has merit for web designers and online marketers regarding how to enhance interactive online web applications.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of investment in information technology (IT) by organizations worldwide has made user acceptance an increasingly critical technology implementation and management issue. While such acceptance has received fairly extensive attention from previous research, additional efforts are needed to examine or validate existing research results, particularly those involving different technologies, user populations, and/or organizational contexts. In response, this paper reports a research work that examined the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in explaining physicians' decisions to accept telemedicine technology in the health-care context. The technology, the user group, and the organizational context are all new to IT acceptance/adoption research. The study also addressed a pragmatic technology management need resulting from millions of dollars invested by healthcare organizations in developing and implementing telemedicine programs in recent years. The model's overall fit, explanatory power, and the individual causal links that it postulates were evaluated by examining the acceptance of telemedicine technology among physicians practicing at public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. The authors' results suggested that TAM was able to provide a reasonable depiction of physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology. Perceived usefulness was found to be a significant determinant of attitude and intention but perceived ease of use was not. The relatively low R-square of the model suggests both the limitations of the parsimonious model and the need for incorporating additional factors or integrating with other IT acceptance models in order to improve its specificity and explanatory utility in a health-care context. Based on the study findings, implications for user technology acceptance research and telemedicine management are discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate user perceptions of mobile app characteristics and interrelationships among identified mobile app characteristics, perceived benefits and post-adoption behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: Using a self-administered online survey (n = 503) drawn from a consumer panel of US smartphone users, this study tests the proposed model that explains why stickiness and word of mouth (WOM) are enhanced during the post-adoption stage. Findings: The results indicate that user perceptions of mobile app characteristics, perceived ubiquity, perceived informativeness and perceived personalization are positively associated with mobile app usefulness, thereby leading to increased stickiness and positive WOM intentions. Furthermore, perceived personalization is found to become the strongest predictor of usefulness and playful engagement with the mobile app. Research limitations/implications: The findings are derived from a one-shot correlational study. There is no guarantee that the proposed model establishes causal directions among the latent constructs. Therefore, future research should test the conceptual model in an experimental setting by manipulating the degree and types of ubiquity, informativeness and personalization. Practical implications: The findings of this research provide managerial guidelines for developing effective mobile app strategies involving utilitarian and hedonic benefits, thereby enhancing user stickiness and WOM intentions. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to develop a conceptual framework that integrates user perceptions of mobile app characteristics into the underlying process of post-adoption behaviors. It empirically demonstrates the importance of ubiquity, informativeness and personalization in building and sustaining loyal relationships with mobile app users.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The development of mental models is the underlying ‘driving force' that forms the basis for all teaching and learning activities. Such models also play an important and fundamental role in dialogue and communication processes (writing, reading, talking and listening), thinking and problem solving activities. The formation and subsequent adaptation of mental models takes place throughout a human's life‐span. The ‘richness' of an individual's mental models usually increases with his/her growing maturity and exposure to new and varied experiences ‐ and may, ultimately, lead to ‘expert performance'. This type of behaviour, within a given subject domain, can often be positively correlated with the quality of the mental models involved. Because of their importance, this paper discusses the basic nature of mental models and the need to provide appropriate environments to stimulate their ongoing development within the context of providing mechanisms for the support of lifelong learning.},

We find that quantity-related facilitators (perceived quantity-sufficiency, perceived quantity-overload, and information specificity of search) and environment-related facilitators (application store coherence and user-generated reviews) all influence application discoverability, which affects user satisfaction.

Results indicated that recognition and categorization were often affected differently by experimental variables. However, mental models used in categorization sometimes hindered development of experiential (case-based) knowledge, leading to lower levels of case recognition and suboptimal categorization performance. When mental models were complex or difficult to discover (non-salient), subjects often used experiential knowledge to classify into categories, resulting in dependence between categorization and recognition. A model of interactions between the two tasks is proposed that postulates two separate but interacting types of knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Most organizations realize the importance of integrating new employees, but many fail in this regard, often because of five pervasive myths about the process: (1) the best newcomers can fend for themselves, (2) a massive information dump allows newcomers to obtain what they need, (3) cursory introductions are all that's needed, (4) first assignments should be small, compact and quickly achievable, and (5) mentors are best for getting newcomers integrated.

We de- scribe a large-scale deployment-based research study that logged detailed application usage information from over 4,100 users of Android-powered mobile devices. We present two types of results from analyzing this data: basic descrip- tive statistics and contextual descriptive statistics. In the case of the former, we find that the average session with an appli- cation lasts less than a minute, even though users spend al- most an hour a day using their phones. Our contextual find- ings include those related to time of day and location. For instance, we show that news applications are most popular in the morning and games are at night, but communication applications dominate through most of the day. We also find that despite the variety of apps available, communication ap- plications are almost always the first used upon a device's waking from sleep. In addition, we discuss the notion of a virtual application sensor, which we used to collect the data.},

@article{Rasmussen1983,
abstract = {Collision warning systems offer a promising approach to mitigate rear-end collisions, but substantial uncertainty exists regarding the joint performance of the driver and the collision warning algorithms. A simple deterministic model of driver performance was used to examine kinematics-based and perceptual-based rear-end collision avoidance algorithms over a range of collision situations, algorithm parameters, and assumptions regarding driver performance. The results show that the assumptions concerning driver reaction times have important consequences for algorithm performance, with underestimates dramatically undermining the safety benefit of the warning. Additionally, under some circumstances, when drivers rely on the warning algorithms, larger headways can result in more severe collisions. This reflects the nonlinear interaction among the collision situation, the algorithm, and driver response that should not be attributed to the complexities of driver behavior but to the kinematics of the situation. Comparisons made with experimental data demonstrate that a simple human performance model can capture important elements of system performance and complement expensive human-in-the-loop experiments. Actual or potential applications of this research include selection of an appropriate algorithm, more accurate specification of algorithm parameters, and guidance for future experiments.},

abstract = {The transition to college is a difficult time for most students. Students experience changes in interpersonal and social adjustment, academic and career concerns, as well as personal change (Bishop, Gallagher, {\&} Cohen, 2000). For adult learners this transition can be further complicated by working full-time and family responsibilities. Thus, failure of any student to not successfully adjust and acclimate into his or her new college community can greatly affect the student's persistence and academic success (Tinto, 1993). While most colleges offer a short term in-person orientation to help new traditional-aged students integrate into a college campus, adult students are often left without an option. Though, an alternative method of orienting, acclimating, and supporting adult learners might be realized through the use of virtual and Web 2.0 technologies. Through this method, college staff and faculty members can onboard adult students to campus by virtually interacting, advising, communicating, and supporting them. Additionally, a virtual onboarding program can encourage adults to socialize with their peers and be acclimated to campus support services and offices, in an effort to increase a student's social integration and interaction, academic preparation and success, and college adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract = {A separate and distinct interaction with both the actual e-vendor and with its IT Web site interface is at the heart of online shopping. Previous research has established, accordingly, that online purchase intentions are the product of both consumer assessments of the IT itself-specifi- cally its perceived usefulness and ease-of-use (TAM)-and trust in the e-vendor. But these per- spectives have been examined independently by IS researchers. Integrating these two perspectives and examining the factors that build online trust in an environment that lacks the typical human inter- action that often leads to trust in other circum- stances advances our understanding of these constructs and their linkages to behavior. Our research on experienced repeat online shoppers shows that consumer trust is as important to online commerce as the widely accepted TAM use-antecedents, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Together these variable sets explain a considerable proportion of variance in intended behavior. The study also provides evi- dence that online trust is built through (1) a belief that the vendor has nothing to gain by cheating, (2) a belief that there are safety mechanisms built into the Web site, and (3) by having a typical interface, (4) one that is, moreover, easy to use},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify best practices of employee onboarding, the process by which a new employee is introduced to an organization and its vision, mission, and values. Design/methodology/approach - Researchers requested that members of the Personnel Administrators and Staff Development Officers Discussion Group of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) share documents related to employee onboarding and three researchers independently reviewed the documents. The collected documents were compared to the socialization model proposed by Raymond Noe, including the detailed aspects of the organizational phase and the key components identified in the best practices literature. Findings - In total, 17 institutions submitted documentation for review. All institutions discussed at least one or more of the key areas identified in the socialization process. Every institution in the study included a discussion of job expectations and evaluation criteria (100 percent); ten (59 percent) discuss mission, vision, and values; however, topics such as culture (five or 29 percent) and politics (one or 6 percent) were infrequently covered. Onboarding programs varied in length (one week to more than six months). Check lists were the most common tool used to manage the onboarding process. Other notable topics covered include dealing with change, understanding the team-based environment, diversity, library awards and library fundraising. Research limitations/implications - Because of the limited number of documents examined in this study, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - Moving from a traditional new employee orientation model to a best-practices onboarding model will require HR professionals to conduct an internal assessment of the current program. Originality/value - Due to the high cost associated with recruiting new employees, the need for new employees to be fully functional and engaged as soon as possible, and the need to communicate performance indicators, the need to share best practices is important.},

abstract = {The mobile Internet, which gives access to the World Wide Web through a mobile device, has been gaining in popularity. The mobile Internet differs from the tradi- tional stationary Internet in that it can be used in a wider variety of contexts. How- ever, no studies have identified the contexts in which mobile Internet services are used most frequently, or determined which contexts exert significant influence on a user's choice of mobile service. This article proposes a framework of use contexts that reflects the characteristics of the mobile Internet. To explore these contexts, a re- search method was devised and a longitudinal monitoring study was conducted. The results indicate that mobile Internet use is heavily clustered around a few key contexts, rather than dispersed widely over diverse contexts. Further, participants in the monitoring study were found to concentrate their use on a few mobile services, rather than on exploring diverse services. Perhaps most interestingly, some contex- tual factors were found to correlate closely with the selection of specific mobile Internet services. On the basis of these results, the article concludes with implica- tions for developers of mobile Internet services.},

abstract = {User experience (UX) consists of all aspects of interactions between a user and a product. Recently, many studies have been conducted to define the UX concept, but few studies have attempted to quantify UX. This paper proposed quantification models that integrate major elements of UX into a single index. A variety of models were proposed and evaluated including compensatory (i.e. simple linear, polynomial and S-shaped value) and non-compensatory (i.e. conjunctive and disjunctive) models. A case study with a commercial tablet PC was conducted in which a total of 26 subjects participated in a laboratory environment. Each participant performed a pretest ensuring the ability to make ratio judgments and then evaluated predefined dimensions with the modified magnitude estimation procedure. A total of 22 hierarchical dimensions were evaluated such as overall UX, its elements (i.e. usability, affect and user value) and sub-elements. Both compensatory and non-compensatory models had high performance in terms of goodness of fit. The results of this study are expected to help product or service designers develop indices representing an overall UX value. Relevance to industry: This study proposed quantification models that aggregate elements of UX. Although the UX index has been controversial, the single value developed by the models can be expected to help decision-makers understand about products or services intuitively. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We derived a “cognitive walkthrough” procedure for systematically evaluating features of an interface in the context of the theory. Four people independently applied this procedure to four alternative interfaces for which we have empirical usability data. Consideration of the walkthrough sheds light on the consistency with which such a procedure can be applied as well as the accuracy of the results.},

However, these automated tools cannot assess people's perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one's location information, but people would likely view the map's use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users' expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people's expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.},

abstract = {The smartphone penetrates many facets of everyday life, including travel. As such, this article argues that since travel can be considered a special stage of technology use, understanding how the smartphone shapes the tourist experience cannot be separated from the way it is used in one's everyday life. On the basis of a study of American travelers, this study uses adaptive structuration theory as a lens to identify a number of spillover effects from smartphone use in everyday life into travel. The results of this study offer several important implications for both research and practice as well as future directions for the study of mobile technology in tourism. Keywords},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a dramatic proliferation of mobile apps, many of which allow for in-app purchases; however, little research has focused on what motivates a user to make such purchases. Based on the Affect–Behavior–Cognition model (ABC model) of attitudes, we developed a model involving perceived value and social influences. The model is then empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 485 users regarding their perception of mobile apps. The findings indicate that stickiness and social identification significantly influence a user's intention to make in-app purchases. Specifically, significant differences were found between users and potential users in terms of antecedents to forming stickiness and making in-app purchases. The results may provide further insights into the development of effective mobile app business models and adoption strategies.},

Unfortunately, beyond simple summaries such as histograms of user ratings, there are few analytic tools that can provide insights into user reviews. In this paper, we propose WisCom, a system that can analyze tens of mil- lions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail. Our system is able to (a) discover inconsistencies in reviews; (b) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app, and provide an interac- tive, zoomable view of how users' reviews evolve over time; and (c) provide valuable insights into the entire app market, identifying users' major concerns and preferences of differ- ent types of apps. Results using our techniques are reported on a 32GB dataset consisting of over 13 million user reviews of 171,493 Android apps in the Google Play Store.

abstract = {Incidental learning is unintentional or unplanned learning that results from other activities. It occurs often in the workplace, during the use of computers, and in the process of completing tasks. Incidental learning occurs in many ways, including the following: through observation, repetition, social interaction, and problem solving; from implicit meanings in the classroom or workplace policies or expectations; by watching or talking to colleagues or experts about tasks; and from being forced to accept or adapt to situations. Incidental learning is situated, contextual, and social. It is thus characterized by those features that are considered most effective in formal learning situations. Incidental learning can result in improved competence, changed attitudes, and growth in interpersonal skills, self-confidence, and self-awareness. Not all unplanned learning is effective, however. Because incidental learning is often not recognized or labeled as learning by learners or others, it is difficult to measure and harness for use. Adult learners often do not distinguish between formally and incidentally acquired learning or prefer incidental learning opportunities to formal ones. Several researchers have examined the issue of how educators can help learners make incidental learning outcomes explicit. An annotated bibliography listing 21 print and Web resources constitutes approximately 75{\%} of this document.},

abstract = {ree products dominate online markets, yet firms struggle to monetize such products and make profits relying on both advertising income and content sold to consumers. We highlight the under-researched topic of product stickiness — consumers' tendency to re-use the product in future periods — in determining optimal firm behavior in such markets. We investigate a case, based on prevalent business models, in which the firm offers a free, advertising-based version of a product and considers to add an ad-free version that customers can purchase out-of-pocket. We show that in such markets stickiness largely drives the dynamics that emerge with different resultant equilibria based on stickiness level. Specifically, price for the premium version increases with stickiness, while optimal advertising intensity is non-monotonic, yet when both increase, price increases more rapidly. Offering a freemium product creates a self-segmentation in which customers with higher product utility switch to the premium version. The result is that the lifetime value of a single downloader of the premium version is larger than that of the downloader of the free version. These dynamics help us explain our finding that the move of the firm from free to a freemium version will provide the highest results under intermediate levels of stickiness.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the onboarding phase for students who are exposed to a blended and open learning environment for the first time, where self-directed learning is key to success. The study was undertaken in a very restricted environment, where the primary motivation of students is the achievement of good grades in the most efficient manner due to extreme time constraints. In past research, we have shown that students have difficulty to move from the traditional setting of frontal lecture and final exam to an open learning environment that focuses more on self-directed learning and peer created content than grades. This work builds on findings that blended learning environment should be adaptive to learner types and gamification features need to be implicit. Adaptivity is not guaranteed through a single platform but instead by involving students in constructing their learning environment. This paper reports on the final set up of the course andthe student evaluation thereof. We show that the current environment with student involvement leads to mostly positive attitudes towards most aspects of the course acro{\ss} virtually all students. Forums are perceived as a barrier as are individual contributions to the cla{\ss} content and are not appropriate features for onboarding. In contrast and despite being difficult, effective use of peer reviews can be shown to match student motivation acro{\ss} all learners. Their use is understood as a means to obtaining a good grade and learning.},

We demonstrate that self-control has consistently stronger effects on application quality and platform stickiness than formal control modes. We also shed light on perceived autonomy as explanatory mechanism through which the control modes' effects are mediated. Taken together, our study highlights the theoretically important finding that self-determination among third-party developers is a stronger driving force than typical hierarchical control mechanisms.

abstract = {A cognitive learning perspective is used to develop and test a model of the relationship between information acquisition and learning in the executive support systems (ESS) context. The model proposes two types of learning: mental model maintenance in which new information fits into existing mental models and confirms them; and mental model building in which mental models are changed to accommodate new information. It also proposes that information acquisition objectives determine the type of learning that is possible. When ESS are used to answer specific questions or solve well-defined problems, they help to fine- tune operations and verify assumptions-in other words, they help to maintain current mental models. However, ESS may be able to challenge fundamental assumptions and help to build new mental models if executives scan through them to help formulate problems and foster creativity. Thirty-six interviews with executive ESS users at seven organizations and a survey of 361 users at 18 additional organizations are used to develop scales to measure the model's constructs and provide support for its relationships. These results support the models prediction that mental model building is more likely with scanning than with focused search. ESS also appear to contribute to mental model maintenance much more often than they do to mental model building. Without a clear focus on mental model building, it seems that business as usual is the more likely outcome.},

abstract = {In teaching theoretical topics, modern STEM education uses interactive hands-on approaches, which support students in understanding the topic instead of teaching them simply how to memorize theoretical concepts. Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.},

abstract = {Attribution theory is concerned with the attempts of ordinary people to understand the causes and implications of the events they witness. It deals with the “naive psychology” of the “man in the street” as he interprets his own behaviors and the actions of others. For man—in the perspective of attribution theory—is an intuitive psychologist who seeks to explain behavior and draw inferences about actors and their environments. To better understand the perceptions and actions of this intuitive scientist, his methods must be explored. The sources of oversight, error, or bias in his assumptions and procedures may have serious consequences, both for the lay psychologist himself and for the society that he builds and perpetuates. These shortcomings, explored from the vantage point of contemporary attribution theory, are the focus of the chapter. The logical or rational schemata employed by intuitive psychologists and the sources of bias in their attempts at understanding, predicting, and controlling the events that unfold around them are considered. Attributional biases in the psychology of prediction, perseverance of social inferences and social theories, and the intuitive psychologist's illusions and insights are described.},
