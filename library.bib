Security concerns surrounding the downloading of apps are often overlooked. The apps on our smart phones can be accessed by the tip of our fingers or the sound of our voice. One must think about the interactive risks to our privacy and the security concerns that can affect our digital lives. This study explores awareness and security risks associated with downloading mobile apps. A total of 124 students were surveyed at two mid-Atlantic Universities. The study found that many students are downloading mobile apps without fully understanding the security risks associated with such action.},

abstract = {The growth of mobile technology mediated environments is accelerated by its accessibility and easy use tools, such as smartphones and tablets. User friendly and intuitive features drive user value and satisfaction. These features motivate and drive further mobile user engagement. Smartphones, for example, allow users to control when, where, and how they engage in chosen activities that serve their needs, saving time, completing a task (utilitarian), entertain them (hedonic), or connect with others (social). Few studies have examined why and how mobile users are continually engaging mobile activities. Focusing on mobile engagement which has not previously been explored, this study investigates, proposes, and tests a mobile user engagement (MoEN) model to explain mobile user engagement intention through user's motivations, perceived value and satisfaction. Findings indicate that mobile users' engagement motivations do influence perceived value, satisfaction and mobile engagement intention. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The usefulness of mobile devices has increased greatly in recent years allowing users to perform more tasks in a mobile context. This increase in usefulness has come at the expense of the usability of these devices in some contexts. We conducted a small review of mobile usability models and found that usability is usually measured in terms of three attributes; effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Other attributes, such as cognitive load, tend to be overlooked in the usability models that are most prominent despite their likely impact on the success or failure of an application. To remedy this we introduces the PACMAD (People At the Centre of Mobile Application Development) usability model which was designed to address the limitations of existing usability models when applied to mobile devices. PACMAD brings together significant attributes from different usability models in order to create a more comprehensive model. None of the attributes that it includes are new, but the existing prominent usability models ignore one or more of them. This could lead to an incomplete usability evaluation. We performed a literature search to compile a collection of studies that evaluate mobile applications and then evaluated the studies using our model. .},

abstract = {The mobile Internet, which gives access to the World Wide Web through a mobile device, has been gaining in popularity. The mobile Internet differs from the tradi- tional stationary Internet in that it can be used in a wider variety of contexts. How- ever, no studies have identified the contexts in which mobile Internet services are used most frequently, or determined which contexts exert significant influence on a user's choice of mobile service. This article proposes a framework of use contexts that reflects the characteristics of the mobile Internet. To explore these contexts, a re- search method was devised and a longitudinal monitoring study was conducted. The results indicate that mobile Internet use is heavily clustered around a few key contexts, rather than dispersed widely over diverse contexts. Further, participants in the monitoring study were found to concentrate their use on a few mobile services, rather than on exploring diverse services. Perhaps most interestingly, some contex- tual factors were found to correlate closely with the selection of specific mobile Internet services. On the basis of these results, the article concludes with implica- tions for developers of mobile Internet services.},

abstract = {While applications for mobile devices have become ex- tremely important in the last few years, little public infor- mation exists on mobile application usage behavior. We de- scribe a large-scale deployment-based research study that logged detailed application usage information from over 4,100 users of Android-powered mobile devices. We present two types of results from analyzing this data: basic descrip- tive statistics and contextual descriptive statistics. In the case of the former, we find that the average session with an appli- cation lasts less than a minute, even though users spend al- most an hour a day using their phones. Our contextual find- ings include those related to time of day and location. For instance, we show that news applications are most popular in the morning and games are at night, but communication applications dominate through most of the day. We also find that despite the variety of apps available, communication ap- plications are almost always the first used upon a device's waking from sleep. In addition, we discuss the notion of a virtual application sensor, which we used to collect the data.},

Onboarding refers to the process that helps new employees learn the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they need to succeed in their new organizations. This process of learning to become an effective organizational member is different from occupational socialization, which focuses on learning the norms of one's profession, such as police officer, scientist, or medical professional. Organizational socialization is influenced by newcomer characteristics and behaviors, as well as by organizational efforts. Newcomer adjustment is associated with important employee and organizational outcomes such as satisfaction, commitment, turnover, and performance. In the past 3 decades, our understanding of a newcomer's adjustment to organizations increased substantially. As employees change jobs more frequently and the cost of replacing an employee increases, understanding and managing the process of socialization will provide competitive advantages to organizations.},

Drawing on self-determination theory and IS control literature, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 138 participants in which we examined how well third-party developers contribute to a mobile app development platform in terms of output quality and whether they are willing to stick with this platform under formal (i.e., output and process) and informal (i.e., self) control. We demonstrate that self-control has consistently stronger effects on application quality and platform stickiness than formal control modes. We also shed light on perceived autonomy as explanatory mechanism through which the control modes' effects are mediated. Taken together, our study highlights the theoretically important finding that self-determination among third-party developers is a stronger driving force than typical hierarchical control mechanisms. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate user perceptions of mobile app characteristics and interrelationships among identified mobile app characteristics, perceived benefits and post-adoption behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: Using a self-administered online survey (n = 503) drawn from a consumer panel of US smartphone users, this study tests the proposed model that explains why stickiness and word of mouth (WOM) are enhanced during the post-adoption stage. Findings: The results indicate that user perceptions of mobile app characteristics, perceived ubiquity, perceived informativeness and perceived personalization are positively associated with mobile app usefulness, thereby leading to increased stickiness and positive WOM intentions. Furthermore, perceived personalization is found to become the strongest predictor of usefulness and playful engagement with the mobile app. Research limitations/implications: The findings are derived from a one-shot correlational study. There is no guarantee that the proposed model establishes causal directions among the latent constructs. Therefore, future research should test the conceptual model in an experimental setting by manipulating the degree and types of ubiquity, informativeness and personalization. Practical implications: The findings of this research provide managerial guidelines for developing effective mobile app strategies involving utilitarian and hedonic benefits, thereby enhancing user stickiness and WOM intentions. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to develop a conceptual framework that integrates user perceptions of mobile app characteristics into the underlying process of post-adoption behaviors. It empirically demonstrates the importance of ubiquity, informativeness and personalization in building and sustaining loyal relationships with mobile app users.},

abstract = {With the continually increasing complexity of e-learning environments, there is a need for integrating concepts of cognitive load theory (CLT) with concepts of human-computer interaction (HCI). Basic concepts of both fields were reviewed and contrasted. A literature review was conducted within the literature database "The Guide to Computing Literature," searching for "cognitive load theory" and "Sweller." Sixty-five publications contained "cognitive load" in their titles or abstracts. Each publication was checked to see whether it contained the concepts of intrinsic, extraneous, or germane cognitive load. The review showed that CLT concepts have been adopted in HCI. However, the concept of germane cognitive load has attracted less attention up to the present time. Two conceptual models are proposed. The first model divides extraneous cognitive load into load induced by the instructional design and load caused by software usage. The model clarifies the focus of traditional usability principles and of existing instructional design principles derived from CLT. The second model fits CLT concepts into the basic components of user-centered design. The concept of germane cognitive load illustrates that an increase of cognitive load can be desirable when designing e-learning environments. Areas for future interdisciplinary research are sketched. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rasmussen1983,
abstract = {Collision warning systems offer a promising approach to mitigate rear-end collisions, but substantial uncertainty exists regarding the joint performance of the driver and the collision warning algorithms. A simple deterministic model of driver performance was used to examine kinematics-based and perceptual-based rear-end collision avoidance algorithms over a range of collision situations, algorithm parameters, and assumptions regarding driver performance. The results show that the assumptions concerning driver reaction times have important consequences for algorithm performance, with underestimates dramatically undermining the safety benefit of the warning. Additionally, under some circumstances, when drivers rely on the warning algorithms, larger headways can result in more severe collisions. This reflects the nonlinear interaction among the collision situation, the algorithm, and driver response that should not be attributed to the complexities of driver behavior but to the kinematics of the situation. Comparisons made with experimental data demonstrate that a simple human performance model can capture important elements of system performance and complement expensive human-in-the-loop experiments. Actual or potential applications of this research include selection of an appropriate algorithm, more accurate specification of algorithm parameters, and guidance for future experiments.},

It deals with the “naive psychology” of the “man in the street” as he interprets his own behaviors and the actions of others. For man—in the perspective of attribution theory—is an intuitive psychologist who seeks to explain behavior and draw inferences about actors and their environments. To better understand the perceptions and actions of this intuitive scientist, his methods must be explored. The sources of oversight, error, or bias in his assumptions and procedures may have serious consequences, both for the lay psychologist himself and for the society that he builds and perpetuates. These shortcomings, explored from the vantage point of contemporary attribution theory, are the focus of the chapter. The logical or rational schemata employed by intuitive psychologists and the sources of bias in their attempts at understanding, predicting, and controlling the events that unfold around them are considered. Attributional biases in the psychology of prediction, perseverance of social inferences and social theories, and the intuitive psychologist's illusions and insights are described.},

Designers need to demystify how we design for user experience and how the products we design achieve specific user experience goals.

abstract = {Recently, there has been a dramatic proliferation of mobile apps, many of which allow for in-app purchases; however, little research has focused on what motivates a user to make such purchases. Based on the Affect–Behavior–Cognition model (ABC model) of attitudes, we developed a model involving perceived value and social influences. The model is then empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 485 users regarding their perception of mobile apps. The findings indicate that stickiness and social identification significantly influence a user's intention to make in-app purchases. Specifically, significant differences were found between users and potential users in terms of antecedents to forming stickiness and making in-app purchases. The results may provide further insights into the development of effective mobile app business models and adoption strategies.},

abstract = {ree products dominate online markets, yet firms struggle to monetize such products and make profits relying on both advertising income and content sold to consumers. We highlight the under-researched topic of product stickiness — consumers' tendency to re-use the product in future periods — in determining optimal firm behavior in such markets. We investigate a case, based on prevalent business models, in which the firm offers a free, advertising-based version of a product and considers to add an ad-free version that customers can purchase out-of-pocket. We show that in such markets stickiness largely drives the dynamics that emerge with different resultant equilibria based on stickiness level. Specifically, price for the premium version increases with stickiness, while optimal advertising intensity is non-monotonic, yet when both increase, price increases more rapidly. Offering a freemium product creates a self-segmentation in which customers with higher product utility switch to the premium version. The result is that the lifetime value of a single downloader of the premium version is larger than that of the downloader of the free version. These dynamics help us explain our finding that the move of the firm from free to a freemium version will provide the highest results under intermediate levels of stickiness.},

abstract = {Context plays a critical role in the user experience (UX) of mobile products. In UX studies, context is often seen as a single entity such as mobile context or car context. More fine-grained categorization of contextual factors is needed when we want to understand how context affects user experience. The purpose of our study was to adapt existing context and experience categorizations, and try out in practice how well these are suited for analyzing the user experience of mobile products. We conducted a ten-day field study where 21 participants reported their experiences of personal mobile products by writing experience reports. The reports were analyzed by using eight context categories to identify the contextual factors. Among these factors we determined the triggering context, which has the major influence on the most meaningful user experience described in a report. Our results show that having a detailed categorization for analyzing contextual factors is valuable for understanding how context affects user experience. This becomes practical in identifying the most meaningful user experiences among the reported ones. We propose that triggering context analysis should become a part of user experience studies of mobile products.},

However, little is known about best-practices in motion gesture design for the mobile computing paradigm. To address this issue, we present the results of a guessability study that elicits end-user motion gestures to invoke commands on a smartphone device. We demonstrate that consensus exists among our participants on parameters of movement and on mappings of motion gestures onto commands. We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set. We highlight the implications of this work to the design of smartphone applications and hardware. Finally, we argue that our results influence best practices in design for all gestural interfaces.},

abstract = {The transition to college is a difficult time for most students. Students experience changes in interpersonal and social adjustment, academic and career concerns, as well as personal change (Bishop, Gallagher, {\&} Cohen, 2000). For adult learners this transition can be further complicated by working full-time and family responsibilities. Thus, failure of any student to not successfully adjust and acclimate into his or her new college community can greatly affect the student's persistence and academic success (Tinto, 1993). While most colleges offer a short term in-person orientation to help new traditional-aged students integrate into a college campus, adult students are often left without an option. Though, an alternative method of orienting, acclimating, and supporting adult learners might be realized through the use of virtual and Web 2.0 technologies. Through this method, college staff and faculty members can onboard adult students to campus by virtually interacting, advising, communicating, and supporting them. Additionally, a virtual onboarding program can encourage adults to socialize with their peers and be acclimated to campus support services and offices, in an effort to increase a student's social integration and interaction, academic preparation and success, and college adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

Most organizations realize the importance of integrating new employees, but many fail in this regard, often because of five pervasive myths about the process: (1) the best newcomers can fend for themselves, (2) a massive information dump allows newcomers to obtain what they need, (3) cursory introductions are all that's needed, (4) first assignments should be small, compact and quickly achievable, and (5) mentors are best for getting newcomers integrated.

abstract = {Incidental learning is unintentional or unplanned learning that results from other activities. It occurs often in the workplace, during the use of computers, and in the process of completing tasks. Incidental learning occurs in many ways, including the following: through observation, repetition, social interaction, and problem solving; from implicit meanings in the classroom or workplace policies or expectations; by watching or talking to colleagues or experts about tasks; and from being forced to accept or adapt to situations. Incidental learning is situated, contextual, and social. It is thus characterized by those features that are considered most effective in formal learning situations. Incidental learning can result in improved competence, changed attitudes, and growth in interpersonal skills, self-confidence, and self-awareness. Not all unplanned learning is effective, however. Because incidental learning is often not recognized or labeled as learning by learners or others, it is difficult to measure and harness for use. Adult learners often do not distinguish between formally and incidentally acquired learning or prefer incidental learning opportunities to formal ones. Several researchers have examined the issue of how educators can help learners make incidental learning outcomes explicit.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify best practices of employee onboarding, the process by which a new employee is introduced to an organization and its vision, mission, and values. Design/methodology/approach - Researchers requested that members of the Personnel Administrators and Staff Development Officers Discussion Group of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) share documents related to employee onboarding and three researchers independently reviewed the documents. The collected documents were compared to the socialization model proposed by Raymond Noe, including the detailed aspects of the organizational phase and the key components identified in the best practices literature. Findings - In total, 17 institutions submitted documentation for review. All institutions discussed at least one or more of the key areas identified in the socialization process. Every institution in the study included a discussion of job expectations and evaluation criteria (100 percent); ten (59 percent) discuss mission, vision, and values; however, topics such as culture (five or 29 percent) and politics (one or 6 percent) were infrequently covered. Onboarding programs varied in length (one week to more than six months). Check lists were the most common tool used to manage the onboarding process. Other notable topics covered include dealing with change, understanding the team-based environment, diversity, library awards and library fundraising. Research limitations/implications - Because of the limited number of documents examined in this study, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - Moving from a traditional new employee orientation model to a best-practices onboarding model will require HR professionals to conduct an internal assessment of the current program. Originality/value - Due to the high cost associated with recruiting new employees, the need for new employees to be fully functional and engaged as soon as possible, and the need to communicate performance indicators, the need to share best practices is important.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the onboarding phase for students who are exposed to a blended and open learning environment for the first time, where self-directed learning is key to success. The study was undertaken in a very restricted environment, where the primary motivation of students is the achievement of good grades in the most efficient manner due to extreme time constraints. In past research, we have shown that students have difficulty to move from the traditional setting of frontal lecture and final exam to an open learning environment that focuses more on self-directed learning and peer created content than grades. This work builds on findings that blended learning environment should be adaptive to learner types and gamification features need to be implicit. Adaptivity is not guaranteed through a single platform but instead by involving students in constructing their learning environment. This paper reports on the final set up of the course andthe student evaluation thereof. We show that the current environment with student involvement leads to mostly positive attitudes towards most aspects of the course acro{\ss} virtually all students. Forums are perceived as a barrier as are individual contributions to the cla{\ss} content and are not appropriate features for onboarding. In contrast and despite being difficult, effective use of peer reviews can be shown to match student motivation acro{\ss} all learners. Their use is understood as a means to obtaining a good grade and learning.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in user experience (UX), it has been hard to gain a common agreement on the nature and scope of UX. In this paper, we report a survey that gathered the views on UX of 275 researchers and practitioners from academia and industry. Most respondents agree that UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective. With respect to the more controversial issues, the authors propose to delineate UX as something individual (instead of social) that emerges from interacting with a product, system, service or an object. The draft ISO definition on UX seems to be in line with the survey findings, although the issues of experiencing anticipated use and the object of UX will require further explication. The outcome of this survey lays ground for understanding, scoping, and defining the concept of user experience.},

More concretely, Carroll (1984) views mental models as information that is input into cognitive structures and processes. What are mental models? Are they always formed? When formed, what are their characteristics? What are the functional consequences of having no model (if that is possible), an immature model, or a mature model?

Drawing on environmental psychology, this paper reports a study investigating how quantity-related facilitators and environment-related facilitators are related to application discoverability, which in turn impacts user satisfaction with the application store. We find that quantity-related facilitators (perceived quantity-sufficiency, perceived quantity-overload, and information specificity of search) and environment-related facilitators (application store coherence and user-generated reviews) all influence application discoverability, which affects user satisfaction. These facilitators play a role in managing the conflicting goals in mobile application stores. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Based on the Affect–Behavior–Cognition model (ABC model) of attitudes, we developed a model involving perceived value and social influences. The model is then empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 485 users regarding their perception of mobile apps. The findings indicate that stickiness and social identification significantly influence a user's intention to make in-app purchases. Specifically, significant differences were found between users and potential users in terms of antecedents to forming stickiness and making in-app purchases. The results may provide further insights into the development of effective mobile app business models and adoption strategies.},

In this empirical study five designs for interactivity are examined using different web-poll interfaces. The goal of the investigation is to examine perceived interactivity in a model which includes most commonly tested cognitive elements such as efficiency and effectiveness, but augments this model with the inclusion of a cognitive–affective element for trust, and an affective element of enjoyment. More specifically, a model is created to validate the relationship of perceived interactivity (comprised of user control, user connectedness, and responsiveness of the web-poll application) to efficiency, effectiveness, trust and enjoyment, of the website. In turn, efficiency, effectiveness, trust, and enjoyment are tested for their influence on user behavioral intentions for e-loyalty. All relationships in the model are supported. In addition, exploratory evaluation of qualitative comments is conducted to investigate additional insights between the five web-poll treatments in this investigation. The research confirms the complexity of a model in which cognitive, cognitive–affective and affective elements are present, and advances knowledge on the consequences of perceived interactivity. In additional to theoretical advancements, the research has merit for web designers and online marketers regarding how to enhance interactive online web applications.},

abstract = {In teaching theoretical topics, modern STEM education uses interactive hands-on approaches, which support students in understanding the topic instead of teaching them simply how to memorize theoretical concepts. Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.},

In this paper we argue that well-designed feedback and progress indicators (FPIs) offer guidance and structure that may encourage mobile app users to move from fragmented learning episodes towards a longer term, reflective learning journey. Drawing from relevant literature we consider how FPIs can be used in the EU-funded MASELTOV project which explores how a suite of smartphone apps can support recent immigrants to Europe to become integrated in their new cities. These apps allow learning episodes to be part of daily activities and interactions. The authors discuss what kinds of FPIs should be provided and introduce the SCAMP model which emphasises five types of FPIs- Social, Cognitive, Affective, Motivational and Progress. Finally, the authors provide examples of FPIs that will be used in the MASELTOV project. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {This report presents preliminary results from an unobtrusive video study of iPhone use – totalling over 100 days of everyday device usage. The data gives us a uniquely detailed view on how messages, social media and internet use are integrated and threaded into daily life, our interaction with others, and everyday events such as transport, communication and entertainment. These initial results seek to address the when, who and what of situated mobile phone use – beginning with understanding the impact of context. We then characterise three key modes of use found in the data: micro-breaks, digital knitting and reading. Finally we consider the multi-party and shared nature of phone use and who is involved. We reflect on analysis to date, designing from understanding use and future work – our data provides the resource and scope for further analysis of the moment-by-moment use of contemporary mobile phones.

abstract = {The term user experience (UX) encompasses the concepts of usability and affective engineering.How- ever, UX has not been defined clearly. In this study, a literature survey, user interview and indirect observation were conducted to develop definitions of UX and its elements. A literature survey investi- gated 127 articles thatwere considered to be helpful to define the concept of UX.An in-depth interview targeted 14 hands-on workers in the Koreanmobile phone industry. An indirect observation captured daily experiences of eight end-users with mobile phones. This study collected various views on UX from academia, industry, and end-users using these three approaches. As a result, this article proposes definitions of UX and its elements: usability, affect, and user value. These results are expected to help design products or services with greater levels of UX.},

@article{Lin2012,
abstract = {Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people's perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one's location information, but people would likely view the map's use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users' expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people's expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.},

abstract = {An interactive computer system was made easier to learn for non-programmers by modifying the on-line HELP and error messages of a system designed primarily for programmers. The modifications included supplementing the existing HELP command with a HELP key, making the content of HELP and error messages more concrete, responding to command synonyms, and more. The systems were evaluated in a between-groups experiment in which office workers with no programming experience were asked to perform a typical office task using one of the unfamiliar interactive computer systems. The results of the experiment supported the inclusion of the modifications. Non-programmers using the modified system completed the computer task in less time, with greater accuracy, and with better resulting attitudes than those who used the system designed primarily for programmers.},

annote = {When the authors are presenting the topic of onboarding and MOOCs there are a lot of unreferenced claims about the importance of the topic. When presenting the different elements of onboarding the authors mix competitor analysis with unreferenced claims about best practices. The methodology of the paper is hard to define; the authors evaluate 6 major MOOC providers without discussing how they analyse them, and make claims that none of the tested MOOC providers have a "smooth" onboarding experience. The suggested improvements to the onboarding process does not target specific problems they have found in the analysis, instead they target larger onboarding concepts. The study has not been an objective one; most of their claims about best practices are unsupported. Their "insights" about the users of MOOCs are unsupported and the language and spelling errors does not persuave the reader. The final value for the reader are some of the targeted areas, that still require additional references and sources, and that providing a good onboarding user experience is difficult.},

abstract = {Two hundred twenty-three subjects worked on an anagram solving task under one of two assigned goal conditions and then self-set goals on a brain-storming task. Both tasks were performed while under one of four specificity conditions. Results revealed that goal specificity raised goal commitment under assigned goal conditions and was related to goal change under self-set goal conditions. In addition, goal specificity was related to individuals' variability in performance across trials under assigned goal conditions. The implications of these results for understanding the goal setting process are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
