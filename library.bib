abstract = {In order to appeal to consumers, mobile application stores face the challenge of finding ways to achieve the seemingly conflicting goals of providing a large quantity of applications and simultaneously making the specific applications that users desire easy to discover. Drawing on environmental psychology, this paper reports a study investigating how quantity-related facilitators and environment-related facilitators are related to application discoverability, which in turn impacts user satisfaction with the application store. We find that quantity-related facilitators (perceived quantity-sufficiency, perceived quantity-overload, and information specificity of search) and environment-related facilitators (application store coherence and user-generated reviews) all influence application discoverability, which affects user satisfaction. These facilitators play a role in managing the conflicting goals in mobile application stores. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Organizational socialization, or onboarding, is a process through which new employees move from being organizational outsiders to becoming organizational insiders. Onboarding refers to the process that helps new employees learn the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they need to succeed in their new organizations. This process of learning to become an effective organizational member is different from occupational socialization, which focuses on learning the norms of one's profession, such as police officer, scientist, or medical professional. Organizational socialization is influenced by newcomer characteristics and behaviors, as well as by organizational efforts. Newcomer adjustment is associated with important employee and organizational outcomes such as satisfaction, commitment, turnover, and performance. In the past 3 decades, our understanding of a newcomer's adjustment to organizations increased substantially. As employees change jobs more frequently and the cost of replacing an employee increases, understanding and managing the process of socialization will provide competitive advantages to organizations.},

The methodology of the paper is hard to define; the authors evaluate 6 major MOOC providers without discussing how they analyse them, and make claims that none of the tested MOOC providers have a "smooth" onboarding experience. The suggested improvements to the onboarding process does not target specific problems they have found in the analysis, instead they target larger onboarding concepts. The study has not been an objective one; most of their claims about best practices are unsupported. Their "insights" about the users of MOOCs are unsupported and the language and spelling errors does not persuave the reader. The final value for the reader are some of the targeted areas, that still require additional references and sources, and that providing a good onboarding user experience is difficult.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the onboarding phase for students who are exposed to a blended and open learning environment for the first time, where self-directed learning is key to success. The study was undertaken in a very restricted environment, where the primary motivation of students is the achievement of good grades in the most efficient manner due to extreme time constraints. In past research, we have shown that students have difficulty to move from the traditional setting of frontal lecture and final exam to an open learning environment that focuses more on self-directed learning and peer created content than grades. This work builds on findings that blended learning environment should be adaptive to learner types and gamification features need to be implicit. Adaptivity is not guaranteed through a single platform but instead by involving students in constructing their learning environment. This paper reports on the final set up of the course andthe student evaluation thereof. We show that the current environment with student involvement leads to mostly positive attitudes towards most aspects of the course acro{\ss} virtually all students. Forums are perceived as a barrier as are individual contributions to the cla{\ss} content and are not appropriate features for onboarding. In contrast and despite being difficult, effective use of peer reviews can be shown to match student motivation acro{\ss} all learners. Their use is understood as a means to obtaining a good grade and learning.},

abstract = {In teaching theoretical topics, modern STEM education uses interactive hands-on approaches, which support students in understanding the topic instead of teaching them simply how to memorize theoretical concepts. Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.},

abstract = {The transition to college is a difficult time for most students. Students experience changes in interpersonal and social adjustment, academic and career concerns, as well as personal change (Bishop, Gallagher, {\&} Cohen, 2000). For adult learners this transition can be further complicated by working full-time and family responsibilities. Thus, failure of any student to not successfully adjust and acclimate into his or her new college community can greatly affect the student's persistence and academic success (Tinto, 1993). While most colleges offer a short term in-person orientation to help new traditional-aged students integrate into a college campus, adult students are often left without an option. Though, an alternative method of orienting, acclimating, and supporting adult learners might be realized through the use of virtual and Web 2.0 technologies. Through this method, college staff and faculty members can onboard adult students to campus by virtually interacting, advising, communicating, and supporting them. Additionally, a virtual onboarding program can encourage adults to socialize with their peers and be acclimated to campus support services and offices, in an effort to increase a student's social integration and interaction, academic preparation and success, and college adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract = {How do managers and companies quickly transform new hires into productive employees, a process called "rapid on-boarding"? The authors contend that companies that are more successful at rapid on-boarding tend to use a relational approach, helping newcomers to rapidly establish a broad network of relationships with coworkers that they can tap to obtain the information they need to become productive. Most organizations realize the importance of integrating new employees, but many fail in this regard, often because of five pervasive myths about the process: (1) the best newcomers can fend for themselves, (2) a massive information dump allows newcomers to obtain what they need, (3) cursory introductions are all that's needed, (4) first assignments should be small, compact and quickly achievable, and (5) mentors are best for getting newcomers integrated. Because of those misconceptions, managers will frequently rely on certain taken-for-granted practices that can actually hinder new employees from becoming productive.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify best practices of employee onboarding, the process by which a new employee is introduced to an organization and its vision, mission, and values. Design/methodology/approach - Researchers requested that members of the Personnel Administrators and Staff Development Officers Discussion Group of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) share documents related to employee onboarding and three researchers independently reviewed the documents. The collected documents were compared to the socialization model proposed by Raymond Noe, including the detailed aspects of the organizational phase and the key components identified in the best practices literature. Findings - In total, 17 institutions submitted documentation for review. All institutions discussed at least one or more of the key areas identified in the socialization process. Every institution in the study included a discussion of job expectations and evaluation criteria (100 percent); ten (59 percent) discuss mission, vision, and values; however, topics such as culture (five or 29 percent) and politics (one or 6 percent) were infrequently covered. Onboarding programs varied in length (one week to more than six months). Check lists were the most common tool used to manage the onboarding process. Other notable topics covered include dealing with change, understanding the team-based environment, diversity, library awards and library fundraising. Research limitations/implications - Because of the limited number of documents examined in this study, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - Moving from a traditional new employee orientation model to a best-practices onboarding model will require HR professionals to conduct an internal assessment of the current program. Originality/value - Due to the high cost associated with recruiting new employees, the need for new employees to be fully functional and engaged as soon as possible, and the need to communicate performance indicators, the need to share best practices is important.},

Our contextual find- ings include those related to time of day and location. For instance, we show that news applications are most popular in the morning and games are at night, but communication applications dominate through most of the day. We also find that despite the variety of apps available, communication ap- plications are almost always the first used upon a device's waking from sleep.

In this empirical study five designs for interactivity are examined using different web-poll interfaces. The goal of the investigation is to examine perceived interactivity in a model which includes most commonly tested cognitive elements such as efficiency and effectiveness, but augments this model with the inclusion of a cognitive–affective element for trust, and an affective element of enjoyment. More specifically, a model is created to validate the relationship of perceived interactivity (comprised of user control, user connectedness, and responsiveness of the web-poll application) to efficiency, effectiveness, trust and enjoyment, of the website. In turn, efficiency, effectiveness, trust, and enjoyment are tested for their influence on user behavioral intentions for e-loyalty. All relationships in the model are supported. In addition, exploratory evaluation of qualitative comments is conducted to investigate additional insights between the five web-poll treatments in this investigation. The research confirms the complexity of a model in which cognitive, cognitive–affective and affective elements are present, and advances knowledge on the consequences of perceived interactivity. In additional to theoretical advancements, the research has merit for web designers and online marketers regarding how to enhance interactive online web applications.},

abstract = {Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people's perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one's location information, but people would likely view the map's use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users' expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people's expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.},
