% WRITE IN PRESENT TENSE!

%%% 1. Explanation of the title of your thesis
% The first function of the abstract is to further explain the title of your thesis. This allows readers of tour thesis to better determine if your thesis is interesting enough for them to read. A well-written abstract can encourage more people to consider your thesis important and, thus, to intend to read it.

%%% 2. Short version of your thesis
% The abstract serves as a short version for readers who don?t have the time to read the complete thesis. Often, managers and scientists read only the abstract and not the entire piece.
