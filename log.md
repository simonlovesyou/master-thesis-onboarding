# Today I'm (supposed to be) done with the literature review
Wednesday, February 15th 2017 - Friday, February 17th 2017

## Log
I've had some setbacks since I started with my master thesis. I have found some research that is similar to mine which I now have to regard and fit into my body of research, which has been quite a challenge. Otherwise I have been writing the Introduction section to my paper, and I have been trying to write it how I would like to have it, and eventually support my claims with sources. I'm going to have to keep doing my literature review and gather more information in the coming week.
