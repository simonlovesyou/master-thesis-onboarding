# Peer review
**15:14** | Wednesday, March 8th 2017 - Friday, March 10th 2017

We've had peer review this week with 3 others from my class. I tried to finish up my report so that it was at least somewhat coherent. We exchanged reports on Tuesday and gave feedback to each other, and I got quite a few good tips from my peers. I've taken most of the general feedback I've received and opened issues for every each one of them to be able to track the progress on them. Most of them will be quick fixes, but some will take longer to fix.

# Trouble
**16:06** | Wednesday, March 1st 2017 - Wednesday, March 8th 2017

I have had trouble keeping up with the log unfortunately. I've had some setbacks with losing half a days work yesterday and having trouble getting a meeting scheduled with SR. The office will work offsite Thursday and Friday, and I have peer review meeting tomorrow so I won't be at the office for the rest of the week.

# Isotop
**_11:04_** _| Tuesday, February 28th 2017_

I'm spending the morning with Simon at Isotop to see how they work with SRs app. I'll probably spend the day after lunch on the theoretical framework.

# Incidental learning
**_17:06_** _| Monday, February 27th 2017_

New week! Today I've tried to decide how I should start my Theoretical Framework. User needs? User behaviour? User motivation? Mental models? Ughh. It's very interesting to read about all these different concepts, but it's hard to mold them all together. I've read a lot today about Incidental learning, which I think is an aspect which we'll use in future work on the thesis.

Tomorrow I'm going to SR to see how they work, and maybe discuss how my thesis work would fit with their app!

# Productive day
**_16:25_** _| Friday, February 24th 2017_

Today has been a productive day, and it feels like I kind of have figured out of I would like to structure my theoretical framework. It also feels like I'm understanding the scope of the project. Hopefully this productive pace will continue next week.

Now: Weekend!

# Friday!
**_09:26_** _| Friday, February 24th 2017_

It's finally friday! Today, I would like to write more on the Theoretical Framework with the resources I found yesterday. See you at the end of the rainbow 🌈

# Le Mond
**_17:15_** _| Thursday, February 23rd 2017_

Today I worked offsite at the café Le Mond close to where I live. I managed to get a lot done, and I found some valuable resources that I have been able to use to further expand my Introduction and base my Theoretical Framework on. It's been a very productive day!

# UX Definition
**_16:48_** _| Tuesday, February 21st 2017_

It felt like I am kind of starting to understand the scope of the project (and it is huge). There are a lot of user experience concepts and aspects I have to cover to be able to create a theoretical framework of the study. To unload my brain I created a chart of the literature review and how things are connected. I might have to redo the chart tomorrow though, since I might use a UX definition which include 3 major aspects (and sub aspects) instead, which I believe will help me specify the field of onboarding.

# More literature review please
**_09:31_** _| Tuesday, February 21st 2017_

Today I would like to be able to do some more literature review and be able to specify my methodology even further.

# User test assistant
**_17:30_** _| Monday, February 20th 2017_

I didn't get as much done today with my report as I wanted. I did find some extra resources and papers on Learnability and I got to sort and label all the reports I have found so far. I did get to assist during a user test and take notes, which was a lot of fun! I have to remember to bring "The design of everyday things" tomorrow, so that I can define User experience properly.

# New week
**_09:31_** _| Monday, February 20th 2017_

Today, according to my schedule, I'm supposed to have a company introduction the entire week. I need to write some more in my literature review and start planning a research method. Today, I would like to get done:
 - User experience definition
 - Learnability

I think learnability is a large aspect in itself to cover, so I think this is a good scope for today.

# Today I'm (supposed to be) done with the literature review
Wednesday, February 15th 2017 - Friday, February 17th 2017

I've had some setbacks since I started with my master thesis. I have found some research that is similar to mine which I now have to regard and fit into my body of research, which has been quite a challenge. Otherwise I have been writing the Introduction section to my paper, and I have been trying to write it how I would like to have it, and eventually support my claims with sources. I'm going to have to keep doing my literature review and gather more information in the coming week.
