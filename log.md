# Productive day
**_16:25_** _| Friday, February 24th 2017_

Today has been a productive day, and it feels like I kind of have figured out of I would like to structure my theoretical framework. It also feels like I'm understanding the scope of the project. Hopefully this productive pace will continue next week.

Now: Weekend!

# Friday!
**_09:26_** _| Friday, February 24th 2017_

It's finally friday! Today, I would like to write more on the Theoretical Framework with the resources I found yesterday. See you at the end of the rainbow 🌈

# Le Mond
**_17:15_** _| Thursday, February 23rd 2017_

Today I worked offsite at the café Le Mond close to where I live. I managed to get a lot done, and I found some valuable resources that I have been able to use to further expand my Introduction and base my Theoretical Framework on. It's been a very productive day!

# UX Definition
**_16:48_** _| Tuesday, February 21st 2017_

It felt like I am kind of starting to understand the scope of the project (and it is huge). There are a lot of user experience concepts and aspects I have to cover to be able to create a theoretical framework of the study. To unload my brain I created a chart of the literature review and how things are connected. I might have to redo the chart tomorrow though, since I might use a UX definition which include 3 major aspects (and sub aspects) instead, which I believe will help me specify the field of onboarding.

# More literature review please
**_09:31_** _| Tuesday, February 21st 2017_

Today I would like to be able to do some more literature review and be able to specify my methodology even further.

# User test assistant
**_17:30_** _| Monday, February 20th 2017_

I didn't get as much done today with my report as I wanted. I did find some extra resources and papers on Learnability and I got to sort and label all the reports I have found so far. I did get to assist during a user test and take notes, which was a lot of fun! I have to remember to bring "The design of everyday things" tomorrow, so that I can define User experience properly.

# New week
**_09:31_** _| Monday, February 20th 2017_

Today, according to my schedule, I'm supposed to have a company introduction the entire week. I need to write some more in my literature review and start planning a research method. Today, I would like to get done:
 - User experience definition
 - Learnability

I think learnability is a large aspect in itself to cover, so I think this is a good scope for today.

# Today I'm (supposed to be) done with the literature review
Wednesday, February 15th 2017 - Friday, February 17th 2017

I've had some setbacks since I started with my master thesis. I have found some research that is similar to mine which I now have to regard and fit into my body of research, which has been quite a challenge. Otherwise I have been writing the Introduction section to my paper, and I have been trying to write it how I would like to have it, and eventually support my claims with sources. I'm going to have to keep doing my literature review and gather more information in the coming week.
