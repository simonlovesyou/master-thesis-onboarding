# UX Definition
16:48 | Tuesday, February 21st 2017

## Log
It felt like I am kind of starting to understand the scope of the project (and it is huge). There are a lot of user experience concepts and aspects I have to cover to be able to create a theoretical framework of the study. To unload my brain I created a chart of the literature review and how things are connected. I might have to redo the chart tomorrow though, since I might use a UX definition which include 3 major aspects (and sub aspects) instead, which I believe will help me specify the field of onboarding.

# More literature review please

Today I would like to be able to do some more literature review and be able to specify my methodology even further.

# User test assistant

## Log
I didn't get as much done today with my report as I wanted. I did find some extra resources and papers on Learnability and I got to sort and label all the reports I have found so far. I did get to assist during a user test and take notes, which was a lot of fun! I have to remember to bring "The design of everyday things" tomorrow, so that I can define User experience properly.

# New week
09:31 | Monday, February 20th 2017

## Log
Today, according to my schedule, I'm supposed to have a company introduction the entire week. I need to write some more in my literature review and start planning a research method. Today, I would like to get done:
 - User experience definition
 - Learnability

I think learnability is a large aspect in itself to cover, so I think this is a good scope for today.

# Today I'm (supposed to be) done with the literature review
Wednesday, February 15th 2017 - Friday, February 17th 2017

## Log
I've had some setbacks since I started with my master thesis. I have found some research that is similar to mine which I now have to regard and fit into my body of research, which has been quite a challenge. Otherwise I have been writing the Introduction section to my paper, and I have been trying to write it how I would like to have it, and eventually support my claims with sources. I'm going to have to keep doing my literature review and gather more information in the coming week.
