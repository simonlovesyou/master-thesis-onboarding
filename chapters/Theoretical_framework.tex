\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{sec:theoretical_background}
% User problems -> Mobile -> Value proposition
To better understand how to provide a good onboarding experience for the mobile app user we have to understand the problems associated with UX-design, both in general and problem mobile devices. We then structure the Theoretical Background with the subsections \textit{acquisition}, \textit{accommodation}, \textit{assimilation} and \textit{acceleration}. These concepts stems from business management context, but to explain them in a user-experience we draw inspiration from cognitive and behavioral psychology. Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology which study higher mental processes of the human mind such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, and thinking \footnote{\url{http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx?tab=3}}. Behavioral psychology and its research field is focused on the environmental determinants of learning and behavior. With the combined resources of these fields of research we define motivations of users to use an applications.

\subsection{Experience}
"Understanding experience is a critical issue for a variety of professions, especially design" \cite{Forlizzi2004}. Forlizzi and Battarbee has identified three different types of experiences; \textit{experience}, \textit{an experience} and \textit{co-experience}.

They claim that an \textit{experience} is a "constant stream of 'self-talk' that happens while we are conscious". This type of experience is, at any given time, how we assess the people, products and environment around us relative to our goals. This type of experience is usually ill-defined for the person, and usually does not have a start or end.

\textit{An experience}, on the other hand, can be articulated by the person who have experienced it. The experience is perceived through the interactions and emotions of the person, and the experience may illicit behavioral and emotional changes. As an experience has been experienced, the person has a sense of completion of the experience and it is stored and categorized in ones mind.

\textit{Co-experience} is about the joined experienced in a social context, and is created or shared together with others. Co-experience is further explained in Section \ref{sec:assimilation}.

\subsection{Acquisition}
% Acqusition Få tag i och förstå sina användare. Hur gör man detta? Man definierar och designar för sin målgrupp, och förstår deras motivation och ge dem vad de behöver. Det finns metoder för detta så som att skapa Personas. Det finns även ett problem så som marknadsföring och app discoverability, men vi ska inte täcka det i denna rapport.
Acquisition is the act of identifying, recruiting, selecting and getting people to join \cite{Bradt2009}. In this section we discuss important concepts such as \textit{Needs}, \textit{Motivation} and two models that describe human behavior; the \textit{Technology Acceptance Model} and \textit{Foggs' Behavioral Model}. Last we discuss the \textit{innovation diffusion theory}.

\subsubsection{Needs}
% Identify the motivation of the user base, explain what motivation is.
To be able to understand how to provide a good user experience, we have to understand the needs of the user, and what value is important to the user to fulfill their need. Maslow’s theory of motivation \cite{Maslow1943} state that humans are motivated by a hierarchy of needs; The 'physiological', the safety, the love, the esteem need and finally the need of self-actualization. Physiological needs are the classic instances of hunger, sex and thirst. Serving one of needs may act as a channel for other needs; someone might be eating because they seek comport rather than for vitamins or nutrients. He explains that when one hierarchy of need has been satisfied the human try to satisfy the next need in the hierarchy, and that the subsequent need has to be fulfilled to be able to care for any of the other needs; "A person who is lacking food, safety, love, and esteem would most probably hunger for food more strongly than for anything else.". The need for safety is the act of seeking a stability in the world where we are away from dangers. If both the physiological and the safety needs are met, then the need for love and belongingness is at the center of concern. The person is now concerned with having friends, a partner and/or children, and will take great strides to do so. When the esteem needs emerge after we have satisfied the physiological, safety and love needs, we strive for a high evaluation of ourselves, for self-respect, or self-esteem, and for the esteem of others. We want to be respected and valued by others, and this need may strive people to engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. Maslow states that this need can be divided into two sets. The first is the desire of self-respect, independence and freedom. Secondly we have the desire for respect from others. Finally, when all precedent needs have been satisfied we reach the need for self-actualization, which refers to the need of self-fulfillment. "What a man \textit{can} be, he \textit{must} be"

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Motivation is what drives human to accomplish things, keeps them interested and committed \ignore{\cite{Ryan and Deci, 2000}}.

It is not the need --- previously discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:needs} --- that motivate people, but the goal to satisfy the need \cite{Maslow1943}. Also, most motivated actions are not to satisfy just one need, but to satisfy multiple needs. A man or woman might partially eat to satisfy hunger and partially feel comfort.

At the level of self-determination, we distinguish between different types of motivation; \textit{intrinsic} and \textit{extrinsic} motivation \cite{Ryan2000a}. These differ in the reason or goal that prompts the execution of some action. Intrinsic motivation specifically refers to the act of doing something due to it being interesting or enjoyable, and extrinsic motivation refers to the act of doing something because it leads to a favorable outcome. The word \textit{Intrinsic} is defined as "belonging to a thing by its very nature"\footnote{\url{http://www.dictionary.com/browse/intrinsic}}, and intrinsic motivation is thought to be a fundamental aspect of the human creature \cite{White1959}. Since we were born, we have had a curiosity of the world with no external incentives to learn and explore it \cite{Ryan2000a}. Extrinsic motivation is the underlying reason an activity is performed to attain some outcome. The final outcome is the facilitator of the activity, and not the activity itself \cite{Ryan2000a}. This is also the main problem with extrinsic motivation; when the external factors disappear so does the motivation\ignore{\cite{Hassenzahl2010}}. It is believed from operant theory that all behaviors are motivated by rewards\ignore{\cite{Skinner1953}}, therefore intrinsically motivated people perform a task because the task itself is rewarding to them, while extrinsically motivated people only perform it to achieve the external reward. Research suggest that higher levels of intrinsic motivation typically lead to a higher willingness to spend more time on a task \cite{Deci1975}. Intrinsic motivation is regarded as the better of the two when designing user experiences, but may be harder for the designer to create.

To improve the users intrinsic motivation, the user interface designer can relate the content and objectives of the application to the needs and interests of the learner \ignore{\cite{Keller1983}}. This can be done by using familiar metaphors and analogies \ignore{\cite{Curtis1984}}. Instructions provided to the user that use a personal style (e.g personal pronouns, names of specific people) rather than formal style may stimulate the user to learn. Also, providing immediate, positive and informative feedback in a context may improve intrinsic motivation, but not necessarily increase or decrease performance \ignore{\cite{(Bates, 1979; Condry, 1977; Deci, 1975, 1971; Keller, 1983)}}. Humor, on the the other hand, has been found to not improve motivation since it can distract the user and interfere with comprehension \ignore{\cite{Markiewicz, 1974; Sternthal & Craig, 1973}}.

Motivation will not alone prompt a user to perform a target behavior. The following sections will discuss two models developed for understanding user informational system adoptance and a behavioral model for persuasive design.

\subsubsection{Technology Acceptance Model}
While there are other theoretical models developed to explain user acceptance and usage behaviour of information technologies, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) \cite{Davis1989} \cite{Davis1989a} is the most widely accepted model and has been validated numerous times, e.g. \cite{Hu1999} \cite{Chau1996} \cite{Mathieson1991}. TAM explain the behavioral intention to use an technology with two major beliefs; \textit{perceived ease of use} and \textit{perceived usefulness}. Perceived ease of use is how much a person believes that the use of some technology will be free of effort. This is believed to be a process of expectancy, since the perceived ease of use is defined in terms of expected effort the user is able to report whether or not their expectancy is correct. Perceived usefulness is how much a person believes that using a technology will enhance their productivity. These two beliefs correlate with each other, as perceived usefulness is an outcome of the users expectancy. A positive perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness, as when the technology is easier to use, the more useful it can be. Davis \cite{Davis1989} has found that perceived ease of use has a direct effect on intention, and in an indirect effect on intention via perceived usefulness, and that it is an initial hurdle for users to overcome for acceptance, adoption and usage of a system \cite{Davis1989a}. Figure \ref{fig:TAM} represent the theoretical model.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{TAM}
  \caption{Theoretical model of Technology Acceptance Model (modified from \cite{Davis1989}).}
  \label{fig:TAM}
\end{figure}

This model implicitly indicate that external variables influence perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. There has been several studies which has defined some of these external variables and extended the model with constructs such as intrinsic motivation, control, emotion \cite{Venkatesh2000}, flow theory \cite{Koufaris2002} and trust \cite{Gefen2003}.

To design an interface to increase perceived ease of use there are a number of ways we can do this. Tractinsky et al. has found a strong correlation between aesthetics and perceived usability, which remain intact from the users initial use to continued use \cite{Tractinsky2000}.

\ignore{
System designers typically attempt to build systems that are easy to use while providing the functionality that the users need to accomplish their tasks. While user interface design is the typical focal point to enhance user acceptance, this research shows that there are multiple factors not directly related to the user system interaction that are perhaps more important (e.g., computer self-efficacy). While a large amount of time during system design and development is typically spent on the user interface, this research suggests that practitioners should spend more time creating a favorable impact on system-independent factors, which have clearly been shown to be more important than user perceptions that relate to the user-system interaction in determining perceived ease of use of a specific system. This is particularly important since at all stages of user experience with a system, general, system-independent constructs play a stronger role than constructs that are a result of the user-system interaction.

Similarly, research should focus on designing managerial interventions that will provide facilitating conditions that favor the creation of positive perceptions about the ease of use of a specific system via perceptions of external control. Researchers and practitioners should attempt to better leverage the individual difference variable of computer playfulness and system-specific perceived enjoyment during the design and development phases of system building, and attempt to incorporate it into end-user training situations. In general, practitioners should design interventions directed at the various determinants of perceived ease of use that go beyond traditional training methods, which typically aim to impart only conceptual and procedural knowledge about a specific system. Organizations should consider putting in place general computer training programs that target increasing computer awareness, enhancing computer self-efficacy, and reducing computer anxiety among employees. Such training programs combined with appropriate facilitating conditions should pave the path for acceptance and usage of new systems. In fact, organizations will benefit particularly from system-specific training interventions that enhance user perceptions about the specific system and their general beliefs about new information technologies (see Compeau 1992).
One of the areas that has not been exploited in practice is the potential for intrinsic motivation to enhance user acceptance and usage. Much prior research (Davisetal.1992;Malone1981a,1981b;Websterand Martocchio 1992; Venkatesh and Speier 1999) has found intrinsic motivation to be an important factor influencing user acceptance and learning. This research has further refined our understanding in this regard by suggesting that general computer playfulness and perceived enjoyment are determinants of perceived ease of use. One example is “fun icons” like the ones introduced in MS-Office 97. A similar example is the use of “warm and fuzzy” screen savers (e.g., flashing cartoons on the screen, some action related to your favorite basketball team, etc.) as a way to cause perceived ease of use of specific systems (used by the individual) to be more favorable. Recent work in IS (Venkatesh 1999) and organizational behavior}

\subsubsection{Foggs' behavior model}
Fogg has developed a model to understand human behavior, called Foggs Behavior Model (FBM) \cite{Fogg2009}. The model states that for a target behavior to happen, the person must have sufficient \textit{motivation}, \textit{ability} and some effective event to \textit{trigger} the behavior. The model is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:FBM}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{FBM}
  \caption{Foggs Behavioral Model (FBM). (modified from \cite{Fogg2009})}
  \label{fig:FBM}
\end{figure}

The representation of the model in Figure \ref{fig:FBM} consist of two axes, where the combination of the two represent how likely a person is to perform a behavior. The horizontal axis represent the persons ability to perform the target behavior, and the vertical axis represent the persons motivation to perform the target behavior. Someone with low ability and motivation would register close to where the axis meet, and someone with high ability and motivation would register close to the target behavior (represented as a black circle). In order for the target behavior to happen at all, people must have some non-zero level of both motivation and ability. Fogg says that this implication for designers is clear: "Increasing motivation is not always the solution. Often increasing ability (making the behavior simpler) is the path for increasing behavior performance" \cite{Fogg2009}.

The target behavior, as visualised in Figure \ref{fig:FBM}, may not always require the greatest motivation and/or ability. Someone with a low motivation might perform a behavior if the behavior is easy to perform. " ... right now I have very low motivation to buy a new car. But if someone offered me a new car for \$1, I would buy it. My ability to pay \$1 is high, so I would buy the car despite my low level of motivation." \cite{Fogg2009}. The same is true if the person has a high motivation and low ability. "If your computer crashes and you fear losing your precious family photos (high motivation!), even if you have low ability with computers, you will work hard with your limited ability to recover the photos." \cite{Fogg2009}.

Fogg states that in most cases the person in question usually has at least a modest level of motivation and ability, and persuasion techniques can increase these levels.

For the behavior to happen, Fogg states that there needs to be an effective trigger that facilitates the behavior. How effective the trigger is is governed by three factors: \begin{enumerate*}
  \item noticing the trigger,
  \item associating the trigger with the target action and
  \item the timing of the trigger
\end{enumerate*}

The timing of the trigger is often what is the missing element of a change in behavior. The figure \ref{fig:FBM} includes the \textit{Action line}, which is represent the concept of behavior activation threshold. When the person has sufficient ability and motivation which places the person above the action line, the trigger will cause the person to perform the target behavior. When ability is low the trigger will cause frustration, and when motivation is low the trigger will be frustrating.

Fogg states that all triggers does not function in the same way, and different triggers may help persuade the person to perform the behavior if they have low ability/motivation.

\begin{description}
  \item[Spark as Trigger] High ability/Low motivation, the \textit{spark} should try and motivate the user to perform the behavior.
  \item[Facilitator as Trigger] Low ability/High motivation, the \textit{facilitator} should try and make the target behavior easier to perform.
  \item[Signal as Trigger]  High ability/High motivation, the \textit{signal} should only remind the person to perform the target behavior.
\end{description}

To increase the ability to help the user get above the activation threshold, we have to understand the elements of simplicity. Fogg has identified six elements, which are interlinked with each other. If one of the requirements of the elements fail, the simplicity is lost.

\begin{description}
  \item[Time] If the target behavior requires time that do not have to perform the target behavior, the behavior is not simple.
  \item[Money] If the target behavior requires money or resources, the disposable amount of resources the person have determines how simple the behavior is. This is usually not a problem for people with a lot of wealth.
  \item[Physical Effort] Behaviors that require physical effort may not be easy to perform. If the physical effort is small, the easier it is for the people to perform the behavior. It is important at this stage to consider the different disabilities of people\ignore{find source}.
  \item[Brain cycles] A task demanding the person to think about it hard might lead to the person finding it difficult to perform. In some cases, the task at hand is not that demanding with this aspect, but the persons mind might be consumed with other issues.
  \item[Social deviance] By social deviance, Fogg says that it means to go against the norm, and breaking the rules of society. If the behavior requires the person to deviate from the expected behavior of society, the behavior is not simple to perform.
  \item[Non-routine] People tend to think that activities they perform on a routine to be easy, while new activities might be hard to perform. While seeking simplicity, the person might resort to perform a task that they are more familiar with, even though the initial target behavior would lead to greater results.
\end{description}

All these elements may apply differently to different people. For instance, depending on the context of use the person might not have a lot of disposable time to perform a task. Fogg conclude that "Simplicity is a function of a person's scarcest resource \textit{at the moment a behavior is triggered.}". Fogg prompts us user researchers to seek for and identify the users scarcest resource and design simplicity with this in mind.

With the mobility of smartphones and its wide range of context of use, the opportunity of using contextual triggers is an important channel for triggering many behaviors \cite{Fogg2009}. One should be vary of the triggers used, as sparks may annoy us because they will seek to motivate a behavior that we may not intend to perform. Users will be most tolerant of triggers when they act as signals or facilitators.

\subsubsection{Innovation Diffusion Theory}

\subsection{Accommodation}
% Accommodation Ge användare de verktyg de behöver för att lyckas. Implicit innebär dessa verktygen att de är användarbara också. Mentala modeler osv. Designa för användning med context.
Accommodation is the act of giving the users the tools they need to be able to succeed \cite{Bradt2009}. For the users to efficiently use the tools given, we have to understand their behavior; how they reason and learn. We discuss the theory of mental models and how us humans perform tasks.

\subsubsection{Behavior}
% similar to http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=hcii
Rasmussen \cite{Rasmussen1983} has identified three typical levels of performance. \textit{The skill-based behavior} represent the subconscious actions and activities which we perform on a "smooth, automated, and highly integrated patterns of behavior". This level of performance is based on a simple feedback loop, where a stimuli facilitate a motor output. \ignore{Provide example of this}

\textit{Rule-based behavior} are patterns of behavior which emerge from previous and similar actions performed in a previous similar occasion. The user acts in a goal-oriented way where the user tries to achieve a goal, which is usually not explicitly stated, with the rules that has empirically evolved through previous successful experiences.

The main differences of skill-based and rule-based behavior is that the person may not consciously be aware of the actions the user perform when performing actions on a skill-based level, and may not be able to recollect why such an action has been taken. The higher level rule-based actions are generally based on "explicit know-how, and the rules used can be reported by the person".

The third, and final level of performance as Rasmussen \cite{Rasmussen1983} has identified, is \textit{knowledge-based}. Knowledge-based performance is used during situations that the user is not familiar with, and where any know-how or rules cannot be used from previous experiences. Rasmussen \cite{Rasmussen1983} states that "In this situation, the goal is explicitly formulated, based on an analysis of the environment and the overall aims of the person. Then a useful plan is developed-by selection-such that different plans are considered, and their effect tested against the goal, physically by trial and error, or conceptually by means of understand the functional properties of the environment and prediction of the effects of the plan is considered." At this level of abstraction, the user represent the system in an internal construct called \textit{mental model}.

\subsubsection{Flow}

\subsubsection{Mental model}
A common concept in the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of \textit{mental models}. Mental models was first introduced by American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, where he argues that humans reason by a process which
"...examines the state of things
asserted in the premises, forms a diagram of that state of things, perceives in the parts of that diagram relations not explicitly mentioned in the premises, satisfies itself by mental experiments upon the diagram that these relations would always subsist, or at least would do so in a certain proportion of cases, and concludes their necessary, or probable, truth." \cite{Pierce1974}

This was further elaborated by the psychologist Kenneth Craik who state that humans construct "small-scale models" of external reality \cite{Craik1967}. These mental models enable us to use past events to be able to react to present events and anticipate future events, to reason, and to understand our environment. Since Craik's contributions, cognitive psychologist has argued that mental models are formed through current and general knowledge, perception and imagination \cite{Johnson-Laird2001} \ignore{Find some more citations to support this claim}. In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) mental models has sometimes been used interchangeably with cognitive and conceptual models, and their difference and usage might be confusing as \cite{Staggers1993} concludes. For the purpose of this paper, we will be using Norman's \cite{Norman2013a} definition of conceptual and mental model, where he states that mental model needs to be consistent with the designers conceptual model. Mental models are the models made from experience, instruction and training which users interact through \cite{Norman2013a}, and the models become more mature as the user experience increase \cite{Barker1998}. Mental models of devices are created mostly through perceiving possible actions and its visible structures afforded by its interface \cite{Norman2013a}. The mental model of the user guide the users expectation of the application, and can guide the users navigation, planning of actions and contribute to the interpretation of interfaces feedback \cite{Jih1992}\ignore{not the actual source}. Mental models may act as both facilitators and inhibitors when learning, depending on the new information \cite{Cho1996}. When the user has acquired an adequate mental model of the structure and possible functions of the system the user is less likely to become disoriented \cite{Jih1992}, but if the user has trouble fitting new information into their current mental mode they experience frustration \cite{DApollonia2004}.

Norman \cite{Norman2013a} provide us with a seven-stage model which describe how users use interactive products.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Forming the goal
  \item Forming the intention
  \item Specifying the action
  \item Executing the action
  \item Perceiving the system state
  \item Interpreting the system state
  \item Evaluating the outcome
\end{enumerate}

This model of actions help us describe how an user explore an interface \cite{}\ignore{Polson and Lewis, 1990}. This approximate model \cite{Norman2013a} is not consciously used by the user, but rather it tries to explain how we perform tasks. The model is cyclic, meaning that the user will experience multiple loops of the model as they explore an interface. The model is developed on the basis that human actions has two aspects; execution and evaluation. Execution is doing something which affect the world, and evaluation is the comparison if the world reached or got closer to a state which was desired by the user. These two aspects have their of stages of performance. The stages of execution involves forming the goal, which may be an abstract representation of what we want to achieve (get to work, eat dinner, pick a movie). The goal forms our intentions to perform an action, which constitutes in an action sequence to be executed to satisfy the intention. Finally in the stage of execution, the action sequence is executed upon the world and we reach the stages of evaluation. The first stage of evaluation is perceiving the systems state. The perception is then interpreted according to our expectations and finally compared to our intentions and goal. As the users try to finish their tasks, there are four critical points where user errors can occur, as identified by \cite{Shneiderman2004}:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item users form an inadequate goal,
  \item users might not find the correct interface touchpoint because of a label or icon that does not sufficiently represent its corresponding action
  \item users may not know what action to perform to get a desired output and
  \item users get misleading feedback from the system
\end{enumerate*}

Getting the user to have a representative mental model of the system is key to any apps success

The user initially start with an intention of achieving a goal, where the goal is often expressed in psychological terms. The system or interface

\subsubsection{Learnability}
More often than not, "interface usage requires learning" \cite{Grossman2009}. Even though there is plentiful of research regarding learnability, its definition is not widely agreed upon. The different definitions consider different scopes of learnability, e.g. Nielsen definition consider the initial learning curve of the user, and that a highly learnable system would be "allowing users to reach a reasonable level of usage proficiency within a short time." What "a reasonably level of usage proficiency" is relative to a "short time" is still unclear, and it leaves a lot to our own imagination. Schneiderman et al. provide us with a more general applicable definition of "the time it takes members of the user community to learn how to use the commands relevant to a set of tasks". Schneiderman et al. also discuss a different aspect which tightly coupled with learnability, which is \textit{Retention over time}; How well is the user able to recall how to use an application after a specific time period? Retention may

\ignore{\url{http://www.lawrence-najjar.com/papers/Principles_of_educational_multimedia_user_interface_design.html}}

The characteristics of the material to learn can significantly affect learning. From a psychological standpoint, the learning characteristics include the medium itself, physical structure, conceptual difficulty, and sequence \ignore{\cite{Bransford1978}}. The follow principles suggest ways to design to improve the interfaces learnability.

Images seem to help the user learn information more effectively. For example, it has been found when testing recall that pictures of common objects had a higher success rate than their textual names. \ignore{\cite{(e.g., Lieberman & Culpepper, 1965; Nelson, Reed, & Walling, 1976; Paivio & Csapo, 1969, 1973; Paivio, Rogers, & Smythe, 1968)}}. This is not true though when the content of the images are similar \ignore{\cite{(Nelson et al., 1976)}} or when they attempt to communicate abstract concepts such as "freedom" or "amount" \ignore{\cite{Nelson ???}}. The combination of images and textual words improves recall \ignore{\cite{Paivio & Csapo, 1973}} and comprehension of text \ignore{\cite{Levie & Lentz, 1982}}

Nugent \ignore{\cite{Nugent1982}} got the highest levels of learning when she presented information as a combination of text and images or text and audio compared to the same content via text, audio or images alone.

Encouraging the user to elaborately learn the material through interactivity may improve learning \ignore{\cite{e.g., Bower & Winzenz, 1970; Jacoby, Craik, & Begg, 1979; Kolers, 1979; Salomon, 1984; Walker, Jones, & Mar, 1983}}. An interactive user interface has found a significant positive contribution to learning \ignore{\cite{Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Stafford, 1990; Verano, 1987}} and retention of knowledge over time \ignore{\cite{Stafford 1990}}. It has also been found that user may learn the learning material faster and may have a better attitude to learning the material when they use an interactive instructional environment. \ignore{\cite{Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990}}

Interaction in itself does not necessarily help the user to learn. The interaction must be cognitively engaging and challenge the user \ignore{\cite{???}}.

Helping the user digest the material through different means will

\ignore{A small number of studies provide limited support for this design principle. Multimedia can help direct the learner's attention to relevant information and improve learning. For example, one study (Baxter, Quarles, & Kosak, 1978) asked adults in a shopping mall to "look over" a newspaper page that included a story with or without a large photograph. When asked questions about their recall of the newspaper story, the participants remembered more information when they saw the story with the photograph than when they saw the story without the photograph. It appears that the photograph got the participants' attention and caused them to read the accompanying story. Other researchers successfully used drawings (e.g., Paradowski, 1967; Tennyson, 1978), motion (Baek & Layne, 1988; Park & Hopkins, 1993), small "chunks" of textual and graphical information (Rieber, 1990b), and adjunct questions (e.g., McConkie, Rayner, & Wilson, 1973; Watts & Anderson, 1971) to focus the learners' attention.

However, getting a learner to pay attention to information does not necessarily mean that the learner will learn the information. For example, learners who are new to a field of knowledge may simply view a supplementary animation without trying to understand the information it shows (e.g., Reed, 1985). Also, irrelevant media, such as unrelated pictures (e.g., Levie & Lentz, 1982) or motion (Park & Hopkins, 1993) may distract learners and actually decrease learning performance.}

\ignore{Processing tasks that encourage learners to integrate the information they are studying seem to improve learning. Several studies (e.g., Anderson & Biddle, 1975; Frase, 1975; Reder, 1979; Rothkopf, 1966) found that periodically asking learners to answer questions about the information they had just reviewed led to improvements in learning performance. Tasks that do not encourage learners to integrate the information may actually worsen learning performance (e.g., Stein & Bransford, 1979; Stein, Morris, & Bransford, 1978).}

\subsubsection{Feedback}
"Indeed, formative assessment and feedback is an important aspect of effectively designed learning environments and should occur continuously and unobtrusively as an integral part of the instruction (Bransford, Brown, \& Cocking, 1999)" \url{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chun-Han_Chiang/publication/220374484_An_Individualized_e-Reading_System_Developed_Based_on_Multi-representations_Approach/links/0deec53488a7b809f8000000.pdf#page=116}

\subsubsection{Human-Computer Dialogue}

If the conceptual model is not clearly communicated to the user and is not properly corrected through computer-human dialog, the user will have trouble performing the tasks they've set out to solve their problem. Studies of blame \ignore{Find these studies}, or \textit{attribution}, has shown that when a fault occurs in a system, the person in question is more likely to attribute the error to system than their own. Similarly, when fortune occurs to a person they are likely to attribute the fortune to their person and intelligence.

If the users mental model is not consistent with the conceptual model provided by the designer, the users mental model can be modified through a \textit{computer-human dialog}

The communication between a user and a computer-based system is through a \textit{user-computer dialogue} \cite{Foley1996}, where the dialogue is communicated through a language of inputs and outputs. Similarly to regular human-to-human conversation, we may provide feedback if something is misunderstood or help the other person finish a sentence. The same is true for human-to-computer communication, where feedback is used to reinforce or discourage the users action, making the user adjust his or her mental model of the system.

The area of psychology that focuses on the environmental determinants of learning and behavior.

\subsubsection{Cognitive load}
The larger the amount of available information is given to the user from an interface, the more likely it is for the user to fall under the pressure of excessive cognitive load. According to \cite{Jih1992}, the user of an interface has to endure three different types of cognitive load; the content of the application, the application structure and the responses and feedback given by the interface. Schneiderman et al. state that "Providing excessive functionality ... is also a danger, because the clutter and complexity make implementation, learning, and usage more difficult".

\subsubsection{Affordances / Signals}

\subsubsection{Incidental and Informal learning}
Incidental learning is unintentional or unplanned learning that results from performing activities \cite{Kerka2000}; activities which primary objective is not to acquire knowledge but to progress while pursuing a goal. As Kerka \cite{Kerka2000} has identified in her literature review of incidental learning, incidental learning may occur "through observations, repetition, social interaction, and problem solving; ...; from mistakes, assumptions, beliefs, and attributions; or from being forced to accept or adapt to situations". Incidental learning at this time was discussed in the context of workplace learning, but as \cite{Marsick2001} conclude, this type of learning happen through "everyday encounters while working and living in a given context". Jones et al. \cite{Jones2014} has drawn the conclusion that this type of learning is particularly suited for smartphone use.

\subsection{Assimilation}
\label{sec:assimilation}
% Assimilation Göra så att de är välkomna i sitt nya område, och om appen erbjuder ett community, att de känner sig välkomna där. Language, welcome
Assimilation is helping the user feel welcome in their new community and environment so that they can accomplish their tasks together \cite{Bradt2009}.

\subsubsection{Community}
Discuss social media and its implications to feeling welcome etc...
\subsubsection{Design}
Discuss different platforms and their interface design language, and how being familiar with a design is good...

Moreover, cultural traits have also been identified as one of the most important
factor that impacts users’ perceptions towards different features of IT and mobile
services (Hiller, 2003)
Cultural differences have undeniable effect on
organizations and behaviour (Sarala, 2010)

First impressions matter. In online communities, potential members
quickly evaluate the community and decide if they want to
participate in it. And community designers want to present potential
members an accurate picture of the community, including what
is expected from members.

Acceleration is helping the user accomplish tasks faster and better \cite{Bradt2009}.

\subsubsection{Mental model maintenance and building}
Acceleration and the improvement of user proficiency is usually accomplished when the user is getting familiar with the interface and the app, and an adequate mental model has been built. When new features are introduced that might help the user accomplish a task faster, the user will initially rely on the mental model they currently have to make sense of the new feature \cite{Orlikowski2000}. New information is fed back to their mental model as the users explore the new features, and two subprocesses may occur: \textit{mental model maintenance}, where the users try and incorporate the new feature into their existing mental model, and \textit{mental model building} where the users reconstruct the mental model to include the new information and knowledge \cite{Vandenbosch1996}. Zhang et al. \cite{Zhang2011} draw the conclusion that when mental model maintenance occur, the user can reaffirm their previous mental model and their existing pattern of usage can continue with much change. Mental model maintenance will therefore lead to a more favourable view of the new feature, and learning it will take less effort. Mental model building, on the other hand, requires modifying, restructuring and sometimes requires entirely discarding previous mental model \cite{Vandenbosch1996}. Mental model building occurs most often when functionality is replaced, whereas mental model maintenance most often occur when functionality is extended or added. Mental model building requires the aid of the application and interface to correct the faulty mental model, such as feedback from actions and information that contrasts with current thinking \cite{Hsu2011}.

\subsubsection{Human interaction with mobile smart devices}
Identifying the context of use is the starting point of human-centered des

In a study where they examined reviews of mobile applications on the iOS operating system, interface design was one of the five most common complaints \cite{Khalid2015}. It was superseded by \textit{Functional error}, \textit{Feature Request}, \textit{App crashing} and \textit{Network Error}.
Designing for mobile devices such as smartphones introduce a number of different unique problems such as small screen sizes, limited connectivity, limited battery and restricted set of available inputs \cite{Zhang2005}. One of the biggest challenges is to consider the context of which they are used in \cite{Zhang2005} \cite{Harrison2013} \cite{Korhonen2010}. Korhonen et. al \cite{Korhonen2010} has identified eight possible contextual factors one has to consider when designing for mobile devices;
\begin{description}
  \item [Environment Context] The environment context describe the surrounding area of the user and the other entities it contains which can affect the user directly or indirectly.
  \item [Personal Context] The personal context describe both the physiological characteristics and attributes (pulse, blood pressure and hair color etc), and the mental attributes of the user (mood, expertise and stress). Mental attributes are most often considered when designing for the context of use.
  \item[Task Context] The task context describe the events, actions and activities the user is currently engaged in. This context also describe if the use of a device is a primary or secondary task.

While modern smart phones are packed with a lot of functionality (GPS navigation, voice and data communication, multimedia consumption, gaming) their small form factor limit the possible input and outputs. The two primary means of input supported by these kind of devices are

\section{Best practice evaluation}
\label{sec:best_practice_evaluation}

To understand the industry and what techniques they deploy to onboard users we have done an analysis of the applications \textit{dots}. All tests were performed on an iPhone 6s+.

\subsection{Dots}

Dots is a puzzle game on iOS and Android where you connect dots together. They use an \textit{interactive tutorial} where the user is introduced to mechanics of the game.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{format=multiline,font=footnotesize}
\begin{minipage}{.33333\textwidth}

  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{dots/1:3.png}
  \captionof{figure}{\\Start of the tutorial}
  \label{fig:1:3}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The title hints to the user that the game is about connecting dots (Figure \ref{fig:1:1} (a)), which is further verified by the first screen when you open the app (Figure \ref{fig:1:2} (a)). The quote leaves out who said "Eventually, everything connects". After pressing OK in Figure \ref{fig:1:2} we are presented with two red dots. The only possible action here is to connect the two dots (Figure \ref{fig:1:4}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\captionsetup{format=multiline,font=footnotesize}
\begin{minipage}{.33333\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{dots/1:4.png}

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{dots/1:6.png}
  \captionof{figure}{\\Next challenge}
  \label{fig:1:6}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

We connect the dots by tapping, holding and dragging between them with one of our fingers. As we do this we can see a line forming at the top and bottom of the screen. As we release our finger we get some positive reinforcement that we successfully completed the task (Figure \ref{fig:1:5}). After pressing the button labeled "OK" we're presented with the text "Make a square" and four purple dots (Figure \ref{fig:1:6}). We know from before (Figure \ref{fig:1:4}) that we can horizontally connect dots, and we can now figure out that we can connect them vertically as well. We also now know that the dots can be of different colors.

  \captionof{figure}{\\Positive reinforcement}
  \label{fig:2:2}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

As we start connecting the dots we can notice that the line at the bottom and top of the screen gets longer as we connect more, so we can deduce that this represent the length of the joined segments. If we connect the dots like in figure \ref{fig:1:7} the dots fall down and we get to start over at figure \ref{fig:1:6}. We only get to proceed if we manage to form a square with the lines as in figure \ref{fig:2:1}. This hints to us as users that it is better to form a square if possible than merely connecting the four dots, but we do not yet know why it is better.

After making a square with the four dots, we get some positive reinforcement, and we get to exclaim "Great!" by pressing the green button in figure \ref{fig:2:2}.

\begin{figure}

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

After pressing "Great!" in figure \ref{fig:2:2} we're presented with an array of dots (Figure \ref{fig:2:3}). Unlike before, this time we're not prompted to do any specific task, but with our newly acquired experience and the order of the colored dots hints to us to connect them in lines, like in figure \ref{fig:2:4}. When there are no more dots to connect we get to proceed to figure \ref{fig:2:5}, and we get the same quote we were first presented with when we opened the app, but now we know that it was Charles Eames who said it. We proceed from here by pressing the only button with the label "Done".

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{format=multiline,font=footnotesize}
\begin{minipage}{.33333\textwidth}

  \captionof{figure}{\\Game screen}
  \label{fig:3:1}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Proceeding from figure \ref{fig:2:5} we're presented with the main menu of the application, and we're presented with seemingly 10 options. Nothing seems to happen when we press the logo of the app (a), (b) hints us that it takes us to some customization options of the app, (c-f) seem to be the main options of the app because of their large size and position in the center. (g-j) are the most vague possible options, with no labels and iconography that may be hard to figure out in the context of the app what they represent. Some possible options (b-f) are represented with round buttons -- (c-f) are labeled, while others (g-j) are represented with just icons.
