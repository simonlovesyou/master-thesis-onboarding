\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{sec:theoretical_background}
% User problems -> Mobile -> Value proposition
To better understand how to provide a good onboarding experience for the mobile app user we have to understand the problems associated with UX-design, both in general and problem associated with mobile devices. We then structure the Theoretical Background with the subsections \textit{acquisition}, \textit{accommodation}, \textit{assimilation} and \textit{acceleration}. These concepts stem from business management onboarding context \cite{Bradt2009}, but to explain them in a user-experience we draw inspiration from cognitive and behavioral psychology. Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology which study higher mental processes of the human mind such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem-solving, and thinking\footnote{\url{http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx?tab=3}}. Behavioral psychology and its research field are focused on the environmental determinants of learning and behavior. With the combined resources of these fields of research we explain factors that influence the adoption and onboarding processes of users.

\subsection{Experience}
\label{sec:experience}
"Understanding experience is a critical issue for a variety of professions, especially design" \cite{Forlizzi2004}. Forlizzi and Battarbee have identified three different types of experiences; \textit{experience}, \textit{an experience} and \textit{co-experience}.

They claim that an \textit{experience} is a "constant stream of 'self-talk' that happens while we are conscious". This type of experience is, at any given time, how we assess the people, products and environment around us relative to our goals. This type of experience is usually not defined for the person, and usually does not have a start or end.

\textit{An experience}, on the other hand, can be recalled, articulated and can be told as an story by the person who have experienced it. An experience is perceived through the interactions, perceptions and emotions of the person, and the experience may illicit behavioral and emotional changes. As an experience has been experienced, the person has a sense of completion of the experience and it is stored and categorized in the individuals mind.

\textit{Co-experience} is about the joined experienced in a social context, and is created or shared together with others. Co-experience is further explained in Section \ref{subsubsec:co-experience}.

\subsection{Acquisition}
% Acqusition Få tag i och förstå sina användare. Hur gör man detta? Man definierar och designar för sin målgrupp, och förstår deras motivation och ge dem vad de behöver. Det finns metoder för detta så som att skapa Personas. Det finns även ett problem så som marknadsföring och app discoverability, men vi ska inte täcka det i denna rapport.
Acquisition is the act of identifying, recruiting, selecting and getting people to join \cite{Bradt2009}. In this section, we discuss important concepts such as \textit{Needs}, \textit{Motivation} and two models that describe human behavior; the \textit{Technology Acceptance Model} and \textit{Foggs' Behavioral Model}. Last we discuss the \textit{innovation diffusion theory}.

\subsubsection{Needs}
\label{subsubsec:needs}
% Identify the motivation of the user base, explain what motivation is.
To be able to understand how to provide a good user experience, we have to understand the needs of the user, and what value is important to the user to fulfill their need. Maslow’s theory of motivation \cite{Maslow1943} state that humans are motivated by a hierarchy of needs; The 'physiological', the safety, the love, the esteem need and finally the need of self-actualization. Physiological needs are the classic instances of hunger, sex and thirst. Serving one of needs may act as a channel for other needs; someone might be eating because they seek comfort rather than for vitamins or nutrients. He explains that when one hierarchy of need has been satisfied the human try to satisfy the next need in the hierarchy and that the subsequent need has to be fulfilled to be able to care for any of the other needs; "A person who is lacking food, safety, love, and esteem would most probably hunger for food more strongly than for anything else.". The need for safety is the act of seeking a stability in the world where we are away from dangers. If both the physiological and the safety needs are met, then the need for love and belongingness is at the center of concern. The person is now concerned with having friends, a partner and/or children, and will take great strides to do so. When the esteem needs emerge after we have satisfied the physiological, safety and love needs, we strive for a high evaluation of ourselves, for self-respect, or self-esteem, and for the esteem of others. We want to be respected and valued by others, and this need may strive people to engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. Maslow states that this need can be divided into two sets. The first is the desire of self-respect, independence and freedom. Secondly, we have the desire for respect from others. Finally, when all precedent needs have been satisfied we reach the need for self-actualization, which refers to the need of self-fulfillment. "What a man \textit{can} be, he \textit{must} be"

\subsubsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motivation}
Motivation is what drives human to accomplish things, keeps them interested and committed \ignore{\cite{Ryan and Deci, 2000}}.

It is not the need --- previously discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:needs} --- that motivate people, but the goal to satisfy the need \cite{Maslow1943}. Also, most motivated actions are not to satisfy just one need, but to satisfy multiple needs. A man or woman might partially eat to satisfy hunger and partially feel comfort.

At the level of self-determination, we distinguish between different types of motivation; \textit{intrinsic} and \textit{extrinsic} motivation \cite{Ryan2000a}. These differ in the reason or goal that prompts the execution of some action. Intrinsic motivation specifically refers to the act of doing something due to it being interesting or enjoyable, and extrinsic motivation refers to the act of doing something because it leads to a favorable outcome. The word \textit{"Intrinsic"} is defined as "belonging to a thing by its very nature"\footnote{\url{http://www.dictionary.com/browse/intrinsic}}, and intrinsic motivation is thought to be a fundamental aspect of the human creature \cite{White1959}. Since we were born, we have had a curiosity about the world with no external incentives to learn and explore it \cite{Ryan2000a}. Extrinsic motivation is the underlying reason an activity is performed to attain some outcome. The final outcome is the facilitator of the activity, and not the activity itself \cite{Ryan2000a}. This is also the main problem with extrinsic motivation; when the external factors disappear so does the motivation\ignore{\cite{Hassenzahl2010}}. It is believed from operant theory that all behaviors are motivated by rewards\ignore{\cite{Skinner1953}}, therefore intrinsically motivated people perform a task because the task itself is rewarding to them, while extrinsically motivated people only perform it to achieve the external reward. Research suggest that higher levels of intrinsic motivation typically lead to a higher willingness to spend more time on a task \cite{Deci1975}. Intrinsic motivation is regarded as the better of the two when designing user experiences, but may be harder for the designer to create.

Keller has created a model for motivational design; the \textit{ARCS} model \cite{Keller1987}. ARCS is an acronym for the four major phases of motivational design. The first phase, (A)ttention, is used to arouse and sustain the interest and attention of the  user. The second phase, (R)elevance, refers to the instruction which target the users needs and goals. The third phase, (C)onfidence, is to through a process build the confidence of the user through repeated success. And finally the fourth phase (S)atisfaction, is to provide reinforcing positive feedback to satisfy the user.

\subsubsection{Technology Acceptance Model}
While there are other theoretical models developed to explain user acceptance and usage behavior of information technologies, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) \cite{Davis1989} \cite{Davis1989a} is the most widely accepted model and has been validated numerous times, e.g. \cite{Hu1999} \cite{Chau1996} \cite{Mathieson1991}. TAM explain the behavioral intention to use a technology with two major beliefs; \textit{perceived ease of use} and \textit{perceived usefulness}. Perceived ease of use is how much a person believes that the use of some technology will be free of effort. This is believed to be a process of expectancy since the perceived ease of use is defined in terms of expected effort the user is able to report whether or not their expectancy is correct. Perceived usefulness is how much a person believes that using a technology will enhance their productivity. These two beliefs correlate with each other, as perceived usefulness is an outcome of the user's expectancy. A positive perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness, as when the technology is easier to use, the more useful it can be. Davis \cite{Davis1989} has found that perceived ease of use has a direct effect on intention, and in an indirect effect on intention via perceived usefulness, and that it is an initial hurdle for users to overcome for acceptance, adoption and usage of a system \cite{Davis1989a}. Figure \ref{fig:TAM} represents the theoretical model.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{TAM}
  \caption{Theoretical model of Technology Acceptance Model (modified from \cite{Davis1989}).}
  \label{fig:TAM}
\end{figure}

This model implicitly indicates that external variables influence perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. There have been several studies which has defined some of these external variables and extended the model with constructs such as intrinsic motivation, control, emotion \cite{Venkatesh2000}, flow theory \cite{Koufaris2002} and trust \cite{Gefen2003}.

To design an interface to increase perceived ease of use there are a number of ways we can do this. Tractinsky et al. have found a strong correlation between aesthetics and perceived usability, which remain intact from the user's initial use to continued use \cite{Tractinsky2000}.

\ignore{There are extensive evidences proving the significance of effect of perceived usefulness on adaptation intention (Chen and Barnes, 2007; Guriting and Ndubisi, 2006; Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005; Eriksson et al., 2005; Hu et al., 1999; Venkatesh, 2000; Venkatesh and Davis, 1996; Venkatesh and Morris, 1996). T an and T eo (2000) suggested that the perceived usefulness is an important factor in determining adaptation of innovations. As a consequence, the greater the perceived usefulness of using electronic banking services, the more likely that electronic banking will be adopted (Polatoglu and Ekin, 2001, Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005). Hence, the researchers posit:}

System designers typically attempt to build systems that are easy to use while providing the functionality that the users need to accomplish their tasks. While user interface design is the typical focal point to enhance user acceptance, this research shows that there are multiple factors not directly related to the user system interaction that is perhaps more important (e.g., computer self-efficacy). While a large amount of time during system design and development is typically spent on the user interface, this research suggests that practitioners should spend more time creating a favorable impact on system-independent factors, which have clearly been shown to be more important than user perceptions that relate to the user-system interaction in determining perceived ease of use of a specific system. This is particularly important since, at all stages of user experience with a system, general, system-independent constructs play a stronger role than constructs that are a result of the user-system interaction.

Similarly, research should focus on designing managerial interventions that will provide facilitating conditions that favor the creation of positive perceptions about the ease of use of a specific system via perceptions of external control. Researchers and practitioners should attempt to better leverage the individual difference variable of computer playfulness and system-specific perceived enjoyment during the design and development phases of system building, and attempt to incorporate it into end-user training situations. In general, practitioners should design interventions directed at the various determinants of perceived ease of use that go beyond traditional training methods, which typically aim to impart only conceptual and procedural knowledge about a specific system. Organizations should consider putting in place general computer training programs that target increasing computer awareness, enhancing computer self-efficacy, and reducing computer anxiety among employees. Such training programs combined with appropriate facilitating conditions should pave the path for acceptance and usage of new systems. In fact, organizations will benefit particularly from system-specific training interventions that enhance user perceptions about the specific system and their general beliefs about new information technologies (see Compeau 1992).
One of the areas that has not been exploited in practice is the potential for intrinsic motivation to enhance user acceptance and usage. Much prior research (Davisetal.1992;Malone1981a,1981b;Websterand Martocchio 1992; Venkatesh and Speier 1999) has found intrinsic motivation to be an important factor influencing user acceptance and learning. This research has further refined our understanding in this regard by suggesting that general computer playfulness and perceived enjoyment are determinants of perceived ease of use. One example is “fun icons” like the ones introduced in MS-Office 97. A similar example is the use of “warm and fuzzy” screen savers (e.g., flashing cartoons on the screen, some action related to your favorite basketball team, etc.) as a way to cause perceived ease of use of specific systems (used by the individual) to be more favorable. Recent work in IS (Venkatesh 1999) and organizational behavior}

\subsubsection{Foggs' behavior model}
Fogg has developed a model to understand human behavior, called Foggs Behavior Model (FBM) \cite{Fogg2009}. The model states that for a target behavior to happen, the person must have sufficient \textit{motivation}, \textit{ability} and some effective event to \textit{trigger} the behavior. The model is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:FBM}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{FBM}
  \caption{Foggs Behavioral Model (FBM). (modified from \cite{Fogg2009})}
  \label{fig:FBM}
\end{figure}

The representation of the model in Figure \ref{fig:FBM} consist of two axes, where the combination of the two represents how likely a person is to perform a behavior. The horizontal axis represents the person's ability to perform the target behavior, and the vertical axis represents the person's motivation to perform the target behavior. Someone with low ability and motivation would register close to where the axis meets, and someone with high ability and motivation would register close to the target behavior (represented by a black circle). In order for the target behavior to happen at all, people must have some non-zero level of both motivation and ability. Fogg says that this implication for designers is clear: "Increasing motivation is not always the solution. Often increasing ability (making the behavior simpler) is the path for increasing behavior performance" \cite{Fogg2009}.

The target behavior, as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:FBM}, may not always require the greatest motivation and/or ability. Someone with a low motivation might perform a behavior if the behavior is easy to perform. " ... right now I have very low motivation to buy a new car. But if someone offered me a new car for \$1, I would buy it. My ability to pay \$1 is high, so I would buy the car despite my low level of motivation." \cite{Fogg2009}. The same is true if the person has a high motivation and low ability. "If your computer crashes and you fear losing your precious family photos (high motivation!), even if you have low ability with computers, you will work hard with your limited ability to recover the photos." \cite{Fogg2009}. This is consistent with findings by Maslow that not all behavior is motivated; like a human's response to the stimuli 'table' would be to picture a table in his/her mind, an action that is not set to satisfy any need \cite{Maslow1943}.

Fogg states that in most cases the person in question usually has at least a modest level of motivation and ability, and persuasion techniques can increase these levels.

For the behavior to happen, Fogg states that there needs to be an effective trigger that facilitates the behavior. How effective the trigger is governed by three factors: \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item noticing the trigger,
  \item associating the trigger with the target action and
  \item the timing of the trigger
\end{enumerate*}

The timing of the trigger is often what is the missing element of a change in behavior. The Figure \ref{fig:FBM} includes the \textit{Action line}, which represents the concept of behavior activation threshold. When the person has sufficient ability and motivation which places the person above the action line, the trigger will cause the person to perform the target behavior. When the ability is low the trigger will cause frustration, and when motivation is low the trigger will be frustrating.

Fogg states that all triggers do not function in the same way, and different triggers may help persuade the person to perform the behavior if they have low ability/motivation.

\begin{description}
  \item[Spark as Trigger] High ability/Low motivation, the \textit{spark} should try and motivate the user to perform the behavior.
  \item[Facilitator as Trigger] Low ability/High motivation, the \textit{facilitator} should try and make the target behavior easier to perform.
  \item[Signal as Trigger]  High ability/High motivation, the \textit{signal} should only remind the person to perform the target behavior.
\end{description}

To increase the ability to help the user get above the activation threshold, we have to understand the elements of simplicity. Fogg has identified six elements, which are interlinked with each other. If one of the requirements of the elements fails, the simplicity is lost.

\begin{description}
  \item[Time] If the target behavior requires time that does not have to perform the target behavior, the behavior is not simple.
  \item[Money] If the target behavior requires money or resources, the disposable amount of resources the person have determines how simple the behavior is. This is usually not a problem for people with a lot of wealth.
  \item[Physical Effort] Behaviors that require physical effort may not be easy to perform. If the physical effort is small, the easier it is for the people to perform the behavior. It is important at this stage to consider the different disabilities of people\ignore{find source}.
  \item[Brain cycles] A task demanding the person to think about it hard might lead to the person finding it difficult to perform. In some cases, the task at hand is not that demanding with this aspect, but the persons mind might be consumed with other issues.
  \item[Social deviance] By social deviance, Fogg says that it means to go against the norm, and breaking the rules of society. If the behavior requires the person to deviate from the expected behavior of society, the behavior is not simple to perform.
  \item[Non-routine] People tend to think that activities they perform on a routine to be easy, while new activities might be hard to perform. While seeking simplicity, the person might resort to perform a task that they are more familiar with, even though the initial target behavior would lead to greater results.
\end{description}

All these elements may apply differently to different people. For instance, depending on the context of use the person might not have a lot of disposable time to perform a task. Fogg conclude that "Simplicity is a function of a person's scarcest resource \textit{at the moment a behavior is triggered.}". Fogg prompts us user researchers to seek for and identify the users scarcest resource and design simplicity with this in mind.

With the mobility of smartphones and its wide range of context of use, the opportunity of using contextual triggers is an important channel for triggering many behaviors \cite{Fogg2009}. One should be vary of the triggers used, as sparks may annoy us because they will seek to motivate a behavior that we may not intend to perform. Users will be most tolerant of triggers when they act as signals or facilitators.

\subsubsection{Innovation Diffusion Theory}
\textit{Diffusion of innovations} is a theory developed by Rogers \cite{Rogers1983} which try to explain how innovation is adopted across different members of a social system. Rogers state that there are four main elements which influence the spread of the innovation to adopters:

\begin{description}
  \item [The innovation itself] An innovation is a new idea, practice, or object. The definition of \textit{new}, whether or not measured as time since its first use or first discovery, does not matter to the human individual. The individual is concerned with his/her own reaction to the innovation, and if the individual perceive the idea as new, it is an innovation.
  \item [Communication channels] A communication channel is what connect an individual, who have knowledge of or has experienced an innovation, with another individual who does not yet have knowledge about an innovation. Communication channels needs to be established between the parties of people who have adopted an innovation and the people who have yet to adopt the innovation for diffusion to occur.
  \item [Time] The time dimension is included in the theory at from the first knowledge of an innovation by an individual to the stage of adoption or rejection, the relative earliness/lateness by which the innovation is adopted compared with other members of the social group and the innovation's rate of adoption in a social group.
  \item [The social system] A social system is defined by Rogers \cite{Rogers1983} as a set of interrelated units that are engaged in join problem-solving to accomplish a common goal. These members may be individuals, informal groups, organizations and/or other subsystems. The social system include several external influences such as news organizations, social media or governmental mandates, and internal influences such as social relationships.
\end{description}

For a more detailed description of these elements, please see \cite{Rogers1983}.

People who have successfully adopted an innovation is categorized into different groups depending on when in the products lifecycle they have adopted the innovation.

\begin{description}
  \item[Innovators] The group \textit{innovators} include individuals which constantly seek information about new ideas. This is more willing to take risks, and their risk tolerance allows them to adopt innovations that may ultimately fail.
  \item[Early adopters] The early adopter are a more integrated part of the local social system than the innovators and have the highest degree of opinion leadership among the adopter categories. They are more discreet about their adoption choices than the innovators to keep their central position as role models to the early majority.
  \item[Early majority] The early majority adopt new ideas just before the average member of a social system, and they may think about the decision to adopt an innovation quite sometime before adopting. This group has above average social status, contact with the early adopters and usually do not hold opinion leadership.
  \item[Late majority] The late majority adopt an innovation after the average participant. They can be persuaded to adopt the new innovation with the help of peer pressure. This group is usually skeptical about an innovation, and almost all uncertainty about an innovation must be removed before the last majority feel safe about adopting.
  \item[Laggards] The laggards are the last to adopt an innovation. This group of people usually show almost none opinion leadership, have lowest social status and oldest among adopters. Their social environment stays within the family.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Innovation_Diffusion}
  \caption{The diffusion of innovation across different adoption groups. (modified from \cite{Rogers1983})}
  \label{fig:Innovation_Diffusion}
\end{figure}

Whether or not an individual adopts an innovation and its affecting factors are conceptualized by Rogers in the \textit{innovation decision process} \cite{Rogers1983}. The process describes the individuals first contact and knowledge of the innovation, the decision to adopt or reject, to implementation of the new idea, and to confirmation of this decision. This process contains five main steps: \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item knowledge,
  \item persuasion,
  \item decision,
  \item implementation and
  \item confirmation.
\end{enumerate*}

\textit{Knowledge} occur when the individual first hears about the innovation's existence and when they gain an understanding of how it works. Rogers discuss three different types of knowledge for adoption; awareness-, "how-to"- and persuasion knowledge. These types of knowledge may be required by actively seeking information about the innovation, but only after first being exposed to the innovation through an external source passively. After gaining \textit{awareness-knowledge} about the innovation, the information seeker may ask questions such as "What is the innovation", "How does it work?" and "Why does it work?". Awareness knowledge motivates the individual to seek "how-to" knowledge and principles knowledge. \textit{How-to knowledge} consists of the information required to use the innovation properly. Complex innovations require more how-to knowledge for proper adoption than less complex innovations, and thus are harder to adopt for the individual. \textit{Persuasion knowledge} is about understanding the underlying technology behind the innovation. For example, understanding biology and plant growth which underlie the innovation of fertilizer. The usage of an innovation without understanding the underlying concepts are usually possible, but the risk of misuse is greater.

\textit{Persuasion} occurs when an individual form a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation. When this occur, the individual may think about the idea in terms of applying the innovation to his or her present or close future. At this stage, the person may ask questions such as "What are the innovation's consequences?" and "What will its advantages and disadvantages when I apply it in my situation?". The information gathered to answer these questions may be scientific, but most peers reach out to friends or people who have used the innovation before. When someone like ourselves tells us about the positive impact of the innovation we are more likely to adopt it ourselves.

\textit{Decision} occurs when the individual engages in activities which will either lead the person to either adopt or reject the innovation. This means for most individuals to try out the new innovation at least partially. This time period as they apply the innovation is often part of the decision to adopt, and its important during this time to decrease the uncertainty of the value to the possible adopter. An accessible trial period of the innovation, e.g. a free sample or free time period, are generally adopted more rapidly compared to an innovation that must be adopted or rejected in its entirety. It is important to remember though that

\textit{Implementation} occurs when an individual has decided to adopt the innovation and puts the innovation into use. All stages prior to the stage of implementation have been mostly a mental exercise for the individual, while the implementation stage involves a change of behavior. Even though the person has decided to adopt the innovation, it is another thing to actually put it into practice. When they reach this stage, the individual may still have uncertainties about the consequences of the innovation. At this stage, the individual will ask questions such as "Where do I obtain the innovation?", "How do I use it?" and "What operational problems may I face with the innovation?". The entirety of the implementation stage may continue for a lengthy period of time, but it will eventually reach a point where its either put into regular use or get exchanged with another new innovation.

The \textit{Confirmation} stage continues after the Implementation stage and will continue for an indefinite period of time. At this stage, the individual seeks reinforcement that their decision to adopt was correct, and if the individual find conflicting messages about the innovation they may reconsider their decision. If the individual find information that he or she should not have adopted the innovation, they will experience \textit{dissonance}. Dissonance occurs when new information become known to an individual which are conflicting with their current knowledge, opinion or behavior. The feeling of dissonance is uncomfortable to the person in question, and he or she will try to reduce it by changing their beliefs, attitude or knowledge. In the case of the confirmation stage, the person may avoid dissonance by only seeking information that only will support and/or confirm their decision to adopt. Contrasting information may still reach the individual which may make him or her doubt their decision to adopt.

\subsection{Accommodation}
% Accommodation Ge användare de verktyg de behöver för att lyckas. Implicit innebär dessa verktygen att de är användarbara också. Mentala modeler osv. Designa för användning med context.
Accommodation is the act of giving the users the tools they need to be able to succeed \cite{Bradt2009}. For the users to efficiently use the tools given, we have to understand their behavior; how they reason and learn. We discuss the theory of mental models and how us humans perform tasks.

\subsubsection{Behavior}
% similar to http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=hcii
Rasmussen \cite{Rasmussen1983} has identified three typical levels of performance. \textit{The skill-based behavior} represents the subconscious actions and activities which we perform on a "smooth, automated, and highly integrated patterns of behavior". This level of performance is based on a simple feedback loop, where stimuli facilitate a motor output (e.g. scratching an itch).

\textit{Rule-based behavior} is patterns of behavior which emerge from previous and similar actions performed in a previous similar occasion. The user acts in a goal-oriented way where the user tries to achieve a goal, which is usually not explicitly stated, with the rules that have empirically evolved through previous successful experiences.

The main differences of skill-based and rule-based behavior are that the person may not consciously be aware of the actions the user perform when performing actions on a skill-based level, and may not be able to recollect why such an action has been taken. The higher level rule-based actions are generally based on "explicit know-how, and the rules used can be reported by the person".

The third, and final level of performance as Rasmussen \cite{Rasmussen1983} has identified, is \textit{knowledge-based}. Knowledge-based performance is used during situations that the user is not familiar with, and where any know-how or rules cannot be used from previous experiences. Rasmussen \cite{Rasmussen1983} states that "In this situation, the goal is explicitly formulated, based on an analysis of the environment and the overall aims of the person. Then a useful plan is developed by selection such that different plans are considered, and their effect tested against the goal, physically by trial and error, or conceptually by means of understanding the functional properties of the environment and prediction of the effects of the plan is considered." At this level of abstraction, the user represents the system in an internal construct called \textit{mental model}.

These three levels of performance are similar to the types of user-product interactions identified by Forlizzi \cite{Forlizzi2004}; \textit{Fluent}, \textit{Cognitive} and \textit{Expressive} interaction.

\begin{description}
  \item[Fluent interactions] between a user and product are performed mostly automatically and do not compete for the users limited attention
  \item[Cognitive interactions], on the other hand, focus on the product and acquire most of the user's attention. When users utilizing this level of interaction between themselves and a product it can result in expanded knowledge, confusion or cognitive error if the product does not work as the users expect. Cognitive experiences often result in some sort of change within the user (such as acquired skill or task award).
  \item[Expressive interaction] help the user form a relationship to the product or some aspect of it. Through expressive interaction, the user can change, modify and/or personalize the product to create a better fit of the product in the user's life. These interactions can usually be expressed by the user as stories where additional value is added by the user
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Flow}
Flow was first conceptualized by Csikszentmihalyi as a mental state of "peak enjoyment, energetic focus, and creative concentration experienced by people engaged in adult play" \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1975}. Research since about this subject has been to understand this phenomenon of intrinsically motivated activity that exceeds that extrinsic good that might result from the activity.

The state of being in flow has been described with the following characteristics by some interviewees \cite{Nakamura2005}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Intense and focused concentration on a particular task
  \item Heightened awareness of applications
  \item Loss of social awareness
  \item Superior sense of control of one's own actions
  \item Distortion of temporal experience
  \item Experience the activity as intrinsically rewarding rather than extrinsically
\end{itemize}

Being in the flow itself is intrinsically rewarding, and the individual who has achieved this heightened state of performance will seek to replicate the experience. As people get better and better executing a task, the challenge of the task gets lessened and is not as involving as before \cite{Nakamura2005}. In order to continue experiencing flow for a particular task, they must actively identify more complex challenges.

Staying in flow requires that the attention is held at the equilibrium of action opportunities and capabilities. If the task at hand is more challenging than the person is capable of the person is most likely to experience anxiety, while if the capabilities of the person are greater than the task requires the person will feel boredom. See Figure \ref{fig:Flow-1} for representation of this original flow model.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{The original model of flow theory. (modified from \cite{Csikszentmihalyi2000})}
  \label{fig:Flow-1}

Since the development of the original flow model (see Figure \ref{fig:Flow-1}), further research has developed the model into a more detailed map with eight categorization instead of three. The eight categories are further divided into the amount of challenge for the task and intensity of experience in the form of concentric rings.

\subsubsection{Mental model}
A common concept in the field of cognitive psychology are \textit{mental models}. Mental models was first introduced by American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, where he argues that humans reason by a process which
"...examines the state of things
asserted in the premises, forms a diagram of that state of things, perceives in the parts of that diagram relations not explicitly mentioned in the premises, satisfies itself by mental experiments upon the diagram that these relations would always subsist, or at least would do so in a certain proportion of cases, and concludes their necessary, or probable, truth." \cite{Pierce1974}

This was further elaborated by the psychologist Kenneth Craik who state that humans construct "small-scale models" of external reality \cite{Craik1967}. These mental models enable us to use past events to be able to react to present events and anticipate future events, to reason and to understand our environment. Since Craik's contributions, a cognitive psychologist has argued that mental models are formed through current and general knowledge, perception and imagination \cite{Johnson-Laird2001}. In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) mental models have sometimes been used interchangeably with cognitive and conceptual models, and their difference and usage might be confusing as \cite{Staggers1993} concludes. For the purpose of this paper, we will be using Norman's \cite{Norman2013a} definition of a conceptual and mental model, where he states that mental model needs to be consistent with the designer's conceptual model. Mental models are the models made from experience, instruction and training which users interact through \cite{Norman2013a}, and the models become more mature as the user experience increase \cite{Barker1998}. Mental models of devices are created mostly through perceiving possible actions and its visible structures afforded by its interface \cite{Norman2013a}. The mental model of the user guide the user's expectation of the application, and can guide the user's navigation, planning of actions and contribute to the interpretation of interfaces feedback as cited by \cite{Jih1992}). Mental models may act as both facilitators and inhibitors when learning, depending on the new information \cite{Cho1996}. When the user has acquired an adequate mental model of the structure and possible functions of the system the user is less likely to become disoriented \cite{Jih1992}, but if the user has trouble fitting new information into their current mental model they experience frustration \cite{DApollonia2004}.

Norman \cite{Norman2013a} provide us with a seven-stage model which describe how users use interactive products.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Forming the goal
  \item Forming the intention
  \item Specifying the action
  \item Executing the action
  \item Perceiving the system state
  \item Interpreting the system state
  \item Evaluating the outcome
\end{enumerate}

This model of action execution helps us describe how a user explore an interface \cite{Polson1990}. This approximate model \cite{Norman2013a} is not consciously used by the user, but rather it tries to explain how we perform tasks. The model is cyclic, meaning that the user will experience multiple loops of the model as they explore an interface. The model is developed on the basis that human actions have two aspects; execution and evaluation. Execution is doing something which affect the world, and evaluation is the comparison if the world reached or got closer to a state which was desired by the user. These two aspects have their of stages of performance. The stages of execution involve forming the goal, which may be an abstract representation of what we want to achieve (get to work, eat dinner, pick a movie). The goal forms our intentions to perform an action, which constitutes in an action sequence to be executed to satisfy the intention. Finally, in the stage of execution, the action sequence is executed upon the world and we reach the stages of evaluation. The first stage of evaluation is perceiving the systems state. The perception is then interpreted according to our expectations and finally compared to our intentions and goal. As the users try to finish their tasks, there are four critical points where user errors can occur, as identified by \cite{Shneiderman2004}:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item users form an inadequate goal,
  \item users might not find the correct interface touchpoint because of a label or icon that does not sufficiently represents its corresponding action
  \item users may not know what action to perform to get a desired output and
  \item users get misleading feedback from the system
\end{enumerate*}

\subsubsection{Expectation-Confirmation Model}
The expectation-confirmation model (ECM) examine the cognitive beliefs and affects that influences one's intention to continue using information systems \cite{Bhattacherjee2001a}. The model stem from Expectation-confirmation theory (ECT) which has been widely used to study consumer satisfaction, post-purchase behavior and service quality control in general (\cite{Anderson1993} \cite{Oliver1981} among others). The process which consumers conclude their satisfaction or dissatisfaction of a product is by \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item forming an initial expectation of the product or service before purchasing,
  \item forming a perception about the performance of the product after a period continued use,
  \item comparing their perceived performance with their initial expectation, and conclude whether or not their expectation has been confirmed,
  \item depending on the level of confirmation and expectation they achieve a certain level of satisfaction of the product.
  \item Finally, depending on the level of satisfaction the consumer decide whether or not to repurchase the product and continue its use. Dissatisfied users discontinue the use of the product.
\end{enumerate*}

The feeling of \textit{satisfaction} of a product has been defined as "the summary psychological state resulting when the emotion surrounding disconfirmed expectations is coupled with the consumer's prior feelings about the consumption experience." by \cite{Oliver1981}, while Bhattacherjee has defined it as "an ex-post evaluation of the users’ initial trial experience with the service as is captured as a positive feeling, satisfaction, indifference or negative feeling (dissatisfaction)" \cite{Bhattacherjee2001}. Both definitions imply a that the state of satisfaction is based on the appraisal of expectation versus outcome, as expectation sets the bar for the customer to which the customer will compare the product to. A lower expectation and/or higher product performance lead to a greater level of confirmation, which dictates the customer's satisfaction. A high expectation and/or low product performance lead to disconfirmation, dissatisfaction and an intention of product discontinuance.

According to the ECM, the person using an IS continually adjust their perception of the perceived usefulness about the IS as they acquire new information. The model proposes that perceived usefulness and confirmation are the leading factors that determine the willingness of IS continuance through satisfaction. As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:ECM} confirmation also influence perceived usefulness.

\subsubsection{Learnability}
More often than not, "interface usage requires learning" \cite{Grossman2009}, and the growing number of product which do not have any formal documentation need to be learned in a few minutes or risk being abandoned \cite{Bergman2000}. Even though there is plentiful of research regarding learnability, its definition is not widely agreed upon. The different definitions consider different scopes of learnability, e.g. Nielsen definition consider the initial learning curve of the user, and that a highly learnable system would be "allowing users to reach a reasonable level of usage proficiency within a short time." What "a reasonable level of usage proficiency" is relative to a "short time" is still unclear, and it leaves a lot to our own imagination. Schneiderman and Plaisant provide us with a more general applicable definition of "the time it takes members of the user community to learn how to use the commands relevant to a set of tasks" \cite{Shneiderman2004}. Schneiderman and Plaisant also discuss different aspects which they argue affect interface learnability, which is \textit{Retention over time}; How well is the user able to recall how to use an application after a specific time period? Retention may affect time to learn \cite{Shneiderman2004}.

\begin{description}
  \item[Time to learn] How long does it take for the typical user to learn the required actions to reach a goal?
  \item[Speed of performance] How long does it take to reach the main goals?
  \item[Rate of errors] How many user or interface errors occurs when the users perform the main actions?
  \item[Subjective satisfaction] Did the users have a positive experience using the interface?
\end{description}

Succeeding in each of these categories may be hard for the designer, and succeeding in one category may require trade-offs in another. For instance, if we want to have a low rate of errors we may need to sacrifice speed of performance. The designer and project managers need to identify which of these categories will be most valued by the users \cite{Shneiderman2004}.

\ignore{\url{http://www.lawrence-najjar.com/papers/Principles_of_educational_multimedia_user_interface_design.html}}

The following text will discuss ways to improve learnability through the medium of the material.

Images seem to help the user learn information more effectively. For example, it has been found when testing recall that pictures of common objects had a higher success rate than their textual names \cite{Lieberman1965} \cite{Nelson1976} \cite{Paivio1969} \cite{Paivio1973}. This is not true though when the images represent similar object \cite{Nelson1976} or when they attempt to communicate abstract concepts such as "freedom" or "amount". The combination of images and textual words improves recall \cite{Paivio1973} and comprehension of text \cite{Levie1982}.

Nugent \ignore{\cite{Nugent1982}} got the highest levels of learning when she presented information as a combination of text and images or text and audio compared to the same content via text, audio or images alone. Leung \cite{Leung2009} has found that when using icons for interface functions, labeling them will help users correctly interpret the function. Similarly, a study by Wiedenbeck found that first time user had the best performance with label and icon-label interface, and icon-label had a higher perception of ease of use among participants than icon only and label only \cite{Wiedenbeck1999}.

More design principles are provided by Lohr \cite{Lohr2000} on how to design to make the possibility of learning happen in the context of interface design:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Make the difference between fore- and background as distinct as possible to help the user perceive the signals of the interface correctly.
  \item Help the user understand the hierarchy of instructional tasks by organizing interface elements into meaningful section of information
  \item Design and organize the interface elements into a coherent whole so that the learner has an overall idea of what the environment is like and what is expected of the learner
\end{itemize}

Interaction in itself does not necessarily help the user to learn. The interaction must be cognitively engaging and challenge the user.

\ignore{A small number of studies provide limited support for this design principle. Multimedia can help direct the learner's attention to relevant information and improve learning. For example, one study (Baxter, Quarles, & Kosak, 1978) asked adults in a shopping mall to "look over" a newspaper page that included a story with or without a large photograph. When asked questions about their recall of the newspaper story, the participants remembered more information when they saw the story with the photograph than when they saw the story without the photograph. It appears that the photograph got the participants' attention and caused them to read the accompanying story. Other researchers successfully used drawings (e.g., Paradowski, 1967; Tennyson, 1978), motion (Baek & Layne, 1988; Park & Hopkins, 1993), small "chunks" of textual and graphical information (Rieber, 1990b), and adjunct questions (e.g., McConkie, Rayner, & Wilson, 1973; Watts & Anderson, 1971) to focus the learners' attention.

However, getting a learner to pay attention to information does not necessarily mean that the learner will learn the information. For example, learners who are new to a field of knowledge may simply view a supplementary animation without trying to understand the information it shows (e.g., Reed, 1985). Also, irrelevant media, such as unrelated pictures (e.g., Levie & Lentz, 1982) or motion (Park & Hopkins, 1993) may distract learners and actually decrease learning performance.}

\ignore{Processing tasks that encourage learners to integrate the information they are studying seem to improve learning. Several studies (e.g., Anderson & Biddle, 1975; Frase, 1975; Reder, 1979; Rothkopf, 1966) found that periodically asking learners to answer questions about the information they had just reviewed led to improvements in learning performance. Tasks that do not encourage learners to integrate the information may actually worsen learning performance (e.g., Stein & Bransford, 1979; Stein, Morris, & Bransford, 1978).}

\subsubsection{Feedback}
When the user explores an interface and learn it, feedback "is an important aspect of effectively designed learning environments and should occur continuously and unobtrusively as an integral part of the instruction" as cited by \cite{Afzal2011}. \ignore{\url{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chun-Han_Chiang/publication/220374484_An_Individualized_e-Reading_System_Developed_Based_on_Multi-representsations_Approach/links/0deec53488a7b809f8000000.pdf#page=116}}
Norman \cite{Norman2013a} tells us to provide continuous feedback and clear information about the results of the user's actions. Even the simplest of actions require feedback after the action has been performed, just to show that the system has registered the action \cite{Lewis1994}.

\subsubsection{Human-Computer Dialogue}

If the conceptual model is not clearly communicated to the user and is not properly corrected through computer-human dialog, the user will have trouble performing the tasks they've set out to solve their problem. Studies of blame, or \textit{attribution}, has shown that when a fault occurs in a system, the person in question is more likely to attribute the error to the system than their own. Similarly, when fortune occurs to a person they are likely to attribute the fortune to their person and intelligence.

If the users mental model is not consistent with the conceptual model provided by the designer, the users mental model can be modified through a \textit{computer-human dialog}

The communication between a user and a computer-based system is through a \textit{user-computer dialogue} \cite{Foley1996}, where the dialogue is communicated through a language of inputs and outputs. Similarly to regular human-to-human conversation, we may provide feedback if something is misunderstood or help the other person finish a sentence. The same is true for human-to-computer communication, where feedback is used to reinforce or discourage the user's action, making the user adjust his or her mental model of the system.

The area of psychology that focuses on the environmental determinants of learning and behavior.

%% DESIGN
\subsubsection{Cognitive load}
The larger the amount of available information is given to the user from an interface, the more likely it is for the user to fall under the pressure of excessive cognitive load. According to \cite{Jih1992}, the user of an interface has to endure three different types of cognitive load; the content of the application, the application structure and the responses and feedback given by the interface. Schneiderman et al. state that "Providing excessive functionality ... is also a danger, because the clutter and complexity make implementation, learning, and usage more difficult".

\subsubsection{Affordances / Signals}
Affordances, as defined by Norman, are the actual and perceived properties of an object \cite{Norman2013a}. Perceived affordances are the ways an object communicate how it can be used. Norman's definition of affordances is defined mostly for physical objects and has since denoted its importance in user interface design, saying that the underlying conceptual model is the most important aspect of user experience design \cite{Norman1999}. Hartson's has reaffirmed affordances importance in user interface design, and extended it beyond the physical affordances of an object to an interface's cognitive affordances. Hartman define cognitive affordances as "a design feature that helps, aids, supports, facilitates, or enables thinking and/or knowing about something", while he defines a physical affordance as "A physical affordance is a design feature that helps, aids, supports, facilitates, or enables physically doing something". Hartman continues and says that the cognitive affordances are enormously important to interaction design, and are the key to help the user figure out what to do \cite{Hartson2003}. In Hartman's work, he classifies four different types of affordances, summarized below:

\begin{description}
  \item[Cognitive affordance] A design feature that helps in knowing something (e.g. a button label that hints to the user what will happen if they click it)
  \item[Physical affordance] A design feature that helps the user in doing a physical action of (e.g. a large raised button that is big enough for the user to click on it accurately)
  \item[Sensory affordance] A design feature that  helps the user sense something (e.g. a button label with a font size that is big enough to read)
  \item[Functional affordance] A design feature that helps user accomplish work (e.g. a button with the label "Delete" that will delete an element from the interface)
\end{description}

The roles of these affordance classification allow us to look at the affordance of some design element on the affordance classifications own terms. When considering the affordance of some design element, Hartman provides us with the following questions to design for all the affordance classifications:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is the intended functionality of an element important and/or appropriate to the user? (\textit{functional affordance})
  \item Does the element advertise the purpose and usage of the element, so that the user knows when to interact with the element? (\textit{cognitive affordance})
  \item Will the user be able to sense any visual cues about the element's purpose? (\textit{sensory affordance} in support of \textit{cognitive affordance})
  \item Will the location and size of the element be accessible for the user to interact with? (\textit{physical affordance})
  \item Will the user understand how to interact with the element? (\textit{sensory affordance} in support of \textit{physical affordance})
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Incidental and Informal learning}
Incidental learning is unintentional or unplanned learning that results from performing activities \cite{Kerka2000}; activities which primary objective is not to acquire knowledge but to progress while pursuing a goal. As Kerka \cite{Kerka2000} has identified in her literature review of incidental learning, incidental learning may occur "through observations, repetition, social interaction, and problem-solving; ...; from mistakes, assumptions, beliefs, and attributions; or from being forced to accept or adapt to situations". Incidental learning at this time was discussed in the context of workplace learning, but as \cite{Marsick2001} conclude, this type of learning happen through "everyday encounters while working and living in a given context". Jones et. al \cite{Jones2014} have drawn the conclusion that this type of learning is particularly suited for smartphone use.

\subsection{Assimilation}
\label{sec:assimilation}
% Assimilation Göra så att de är välkomna i sitt nya område, och om appen erbjuder ett community, att de känner sig välkomna där. Language, welcome
Assimilation is helping the user feel welcome in their new community and environment so that they can accomplish their tasks together \cite{Bradt2009}.

\subsubsection{Co-experience}
\label{subsubsec:co-experience}

\textit{Co-experience} is the third way to categorize the user-experience (see Section \ref{sec:experience} for the other two categories) \cite{Forlizzi2004}. Co-experience is the user-experience in an social context. Co-experience consists of the experiences created or shared together with other people. If an individual find a personal experience worth sharing they might bring it up in a social-context, which allows other individuals to interpret the story and contribute to it.

How a co-experience is perceived is greatly affected by the people who experience it. An example given is of this is running out of gas on the countryside with your friends. The experience could be interpreted as a disaster or a fun adventure, depending on the friends perception of the event.

Information systems and their possibility to connect people to share, create, edit and view content with each other can play a large role in creating co-experiences. These type of systems can create a new channels for social interaction among strangers, friends and large communities.

\subsubsection{Community}

A community is no longer defined as a physical space where a relationship between people happen face-to-face, but rather as a set of relationships where people interact socially for mutual benefit. This broader definition is required to accommodate \textit{online communities}, where an online community is defined as a social network that uses computer support as the primary basis of communication among members.  In online communities, potential members are quick to evaluate the community and decide whether or not they want to be a part of it. Community designers want to present the user with an accurate representation of the community and what is expected of the user to be a part of it.

Traditionally, "off-line" groups create entry barriers to make sure that people who join the group are people who are willing to commit and will belong to the group. The nature of the entry barrier may be subjective (submitting a work sample to join an art school) or objective (intelligence test score to join Mensa). Joining a group with an entry barrier, subjective or objective, require some level of commitment from potential members. The entry barrier may be to simple write a signature on a sign-up form or pay a fee to join a gym. These barriers exist in online communities as well, e.g. to join dribbble you need an invite from another member of the community.

It has been found that there is an correlation between the difficulty of an entry barrier and the people's level of commitment to a group once they have passed the barrier \cite{Aronson1959}, which has been verified by Drenner et al \cite{Drenner2008} on a movie recommendation online community where they found that users were four times as likely to contribute to the community if they imposed a higher barrier of entry.


\subsubsection{Uses \& Gratification Theory}
\textit{Users \& Gratification Theory} is concerned with determining why people use a particular media product and what gratification they seek through that media. The theory is based on the notion that users actively seek seek media to satisfy a certain need. The type of need they seek will impact how they interact with the media; if they actively contribute to the content or passively consume the content \cite{Rafaeli2004}. Dholakia et al \cite{Dholakia2004} has categorized the motivations for an individual to be a part of a group into five constructs:

\begin{description}
  \item[Purposive value] refers to the determination to solve a specific purpose, like gaining information or sharing information.
  \item[Self discovery] concerns the individual purpose to learn things about him/herself.
  \item[Maintaining interpersonal connectivity] is the drive to stay in touch with friends or performing activities with other individuals.
  \item[Social enhancement] is the individuals drive to impress members within the community and feel important in the community.
  \item[Entertainment] refers to the individuals drive to relax, have fun, playing with others in the community.
\end{description}

The type of motivation that drives the members of the community varies with the type of community.

\subsubsection{Theory of Social Identity}
The \textit{Theory of Social Identify} is concerned with determing the factors that contribute to an individuals perception of belonging in a group, and why and how they contribute to the group. The social identity of an individual is a part of the persons self-concept, and its the relationship between that person and the group and any emotional attachment to that group \cite{Tajfel1974}. Tajfel posits that an individual will remain a member within a group or seek membership of other groups as long as the memberships contribute positively to the individuals social identity. If a group fails to meet the requirements of the individual the individual will tend to leave the group \textit{unless} leaving the group is impossible due to some external reason that the individual cannot control or it conflicts with other aspects of his or her acceptable social identity \cite{Tajfel1974}.

\ignore{
Moreover, cultural traits have also been identified as one of the most important
factor that impacts users’ perceptions towards different features of IT and mobile
services (Hiller, 2003)
Cultural differences have undeniable effect on
organizations and behaviour (Sarala, 2010)

First impressions matter. In online communities, potential members
quickly evaluate the community and decide if they want to
participate in it. And community designers want to present potential
members an accurate picture of the community, including what
is expected from members.

\subsection{Acceleration}
% http://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.ub.umu.se/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2010.489665?scroll=top&needAccess=true
Acceleration is helping the user accomplish tasks faster and better \cite{Bradt2009}.

\subsubsection{Personalization}
Smart-phones, by their nature, are personal devices, and personalization is an important interaction feature \cite{Karat2003}. Features that can be classified as "personalization" can be everything from display the name of the user to have complex recommendation systems that present relevant information to the user \cite{Kramer2000}. To be able to personalize the experience, information needs to be gathered about the user, while the users value very highly their personal data and might not be willing to share it\cite{Karat2003}.

Karat et. al has proposed a \textit{Personalization Value model}. The model starts with asking the user to opt-in some minimum amount of information about themselves to more effectively complete a task on the service. If the user agrees, immediate value is given to the user in regards to task completion and personalization. This can create a feedback loop, where they receive more value as more personal information is disclosed and progressively opt-in continuously \cite{Karat2003}. The personalization can positively impact ease of use, as the interface may adapt better to the specific user (see Figure \ref{fig:personalization-value}).

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{personalization-value}
  \caption{Personalization Value Model (modified from \cite{Karat2003}).}
  \label{fig:personalization-value}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mental model maintenance and building}
Acceleration and the improvement of user proficiency are usually accomplished when the user is getting familiar with the interface and the app, and an adequate mental model has been built. When new features are introduced that might help the user accomplish a task faster, the user will initially rely on the mental model they currently have to make sense of the new feature \cite{Orlikowski2000}. New information is fed back to their mental model as the users explore the new features, and two subprocesses may occur: \textit{mental model maintenance}, where the users try and incorporate the new feature into their existing mental model, and \textit{mental model building} where the users reconstruct the mental model to include the new information and knowledge \cite{Vandenbosch1996}. Zhang et al. \cite{Zhang2011} draw the conclusion that when mental model maintenance occur, the user can reaffirm their previous mental model and their existing pattern of usage can continue with much change. Mental model maintenance will, therefore, lead to a more favorable view of the new feature, and learn it will take less effort. Mental model building, on the other hand, requires modifying, restructuring and sometimes requires entirely discarding previous mental model \cite{Vandenbosch1996}. Mental model building occurs most often when functionality is replaced, whereas mental model maintenance most often occurs when functionality is extended or added. Mental model building requires the aid of the application and interface to correct the faulty mental model, such as feedback from actions and information that contrasts with current thinking \cite{Hsu2011}.

\subsubsection{Skill mastery}
When an adult acquire skill mastery, they go through five stages of competence where the individual needs to progress from one skill level to the next \cite{Dreyfus2004}.

\begin{description}
  \item[Novice] The novice can follow given rules for determining actions on a basis of some features (e.g. a computer running a program)
  \item[Advanced Beginner] As the novice gains experience applying the rules to different situations, they will be able to differentiate between the situations and accommodate the rules accordingly. (e.g. changing gears on a car depending on the sound of the engine)
  \item[Competence] As the advanced beginner gain more experience, the individual will now take responsibility for their actions since they have progressed from the initial rule set and now use their experience and intuition to drive their decisions. The amount of applicable procedures and situations that they now may have to consider can become overwhelming to the individual, and they will begin to questions whether it is really possible to become a mastery of this skill. Getting through this hurdle is usually by instructing a plan to focus on some aspect of the skill.

\subsubsection{Human interaction with mobile smart devices}
Identifying the context of use is the starting point of human-centered des

In a study where they examined reviews of mobile applications on the iOS operating system, interface design was one of the five most common complaints \cite{Khalid2015}. It was superseded by \textit{Functional error}, \textit{Feature Request}, \textit{App crashing} and \textit{Network Error}.
Designing for mobile devices such as smartphones introduce a number of different unique problems such as small screen sizes, limited connectivity, limited battery and restricted set of available inputs \cite{Zhang2005}. One of the biggest challenges is to consider the context of which they are used in \cite{Zhang2005} \cite{Harrison2013} \cite{Korhonen2010}. Korhonen et. al \cite{Korhonen2010} has identified eight possible contextual factors one has to consider when designing for mobile devices;
\begin{description}
  \item [Environment Context] The environment context describe the surrounding area of the user and the other entities it contains which can affect the user directly or indirectly.
  \item [Personal Context] The personal context describe both the physiological characteristics and attributes (pulse, blood pressure and hair color etc), and the mental attributes of the user (mood, expertise and stress). Mental attributes are most often considered when designing for the context of use.
  \item[Task Context] The task context describes the events, actions and activities the user is currently engaged in. This context also describes if the use of a device is a primary or secondary task.
  \item[Social Context] Expand
  \item[Spatio-Temporal Context] Expand

This section will examine common onboarding techniques employed in the mobile app industry and discuss their benefits and advantages from the users point of view.

\subsection{Coach marks}

When the user use the app for the first time, they are presented with an overlay with a description of the most important features of the app, called \textit{coach marks}. The marks coach the user on how to access the an app functionality and how they work. The marks are usually at the position of the functionality they describe, or with accompanying arrows that point to the feature explaining what it is.

\subsubsection{Benefits}
Benefits of this technique are that the user will get a clear overview of what functionality is provided with the app and how the functionality is accessed by the user.
\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
The user will only see this overlay once, and if they do not remember all marks they might have trouble using the app at a later date. The marks also interrupt the experience, and is another hurdle that the user has to go through to experience the actual app.

Given the limitations of a user’s short-term memory, interfaces should be designed such that very little memorization is required during the performance of tasks [2]

\subsection{Interactive tutorial}

An interactive tutorials are a tool to help the user experience the app incrementally and in a controlled environment. The tutorial showcase and instruct the user how to perform the required actions to use the app.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Benefits}
An interactive tutorial is a good way to introduce the user on how to perform the core interactions that is essential to the usage of the app.

\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
An interactive tutorial is only essential when the number of important core interactions are small and when they are essential to experience the value of the app.

\subsection{Contextual instructions}

Contextual instructions are similar to coach marks as they also point out important functionality and how to access them, but they are \textit{contextual} as they point out the functionality when the user is most likely to try and access the functionality. The instructions can also be consumed by the user one by one, and not all at once.

  \caption{Contextual instructions in the iOS app "Microsoft To-Do"}
  \label{fig:best-practice/contextual-instructions}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Benefits}
Contextual instructions are useful when showcasing the most important functionality on one page of the app.

\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
Instead of providing contextual instructions it might be enough to communicate the interaction and the functionality through the design of the interactive element.

\subsection{Tutorial cards}

Tutorial cards are used to showcase the core functionality of the mobile app in a number of "cards".

  \label{subfig:best-practice/tutorial-cards/tally-4}
\end{subfigure}%
\caption{Tutorial cards in the mobile app "Tally"}
\label{fig:general-overview}
\end{figure}

Tutorial cards are most suited for when the user is most likely to use the app in a context where they have a high ability and motivation to consume the cards, e.g. when the user is at home.
