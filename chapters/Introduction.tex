%% Establish the territory [the situation]
You only have one chance to make a good first impression. The amount of apps smartphone users download on a monthly basis has been steadily decreasing since the launch of the smartphone in 2004 (ref), and the founder of Mobilewalla suggest that users eventually uninstall 80-90\% of all downloaded apps \footnote{\url{http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/MONEY/usaedition/2012-01-31-App-Love-is-Fleeting\_ST\_U.htm}}. Similarly \cite{Perro2016} suggest that 75\% of apps get churned after 90 days, and 22\% of mobile users use an app only once before uninstalling \footnote{\url{http://www.slideshare.net/vaibhavkubadia75/mobile-web-vs-mobile-apps-27540693?from_search=1}}. Industry practitioners and researchers are increasingly mentioning the importance of app stickiness (retention) for a mobile applications success \cite{Perro2016} \cite{IGIGlobal2016} \cite{Kim2016} \footnote{\url{http://info.localytics.com/blog/an-open-letter-to-mary-meeker-we-are-in-a-mobile-engagement-crisis-localytics}}. And it is widely agreed across literature that stickiness will lead improved customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth and revenue \cite{Reichheld2000} \cite{Srinivasan2002} \cite{Hsu2016a}.

The reason a user might uninstall an app and what makes an app "bad" has been previously researched \cite{Lin2012} \cite{Shklovski} \cite{Song2014}. \cite{IGIGlobal2016} has  The reasons found for uninstalling vary with privacy/security concerns, didn't meet users expectations, didn't use the app often etc. The term "app stickiness" is widely used in a marketing context for this type of problem to make sure that apps "sticks" to the users device. \cite{IGIGlobal2016} has linked user experience and its importance with app stickiness, and providing a good onboarding experience for the user will severely reduce abandonment rate \footnote{\url{https://clearbridgemobile.com/5-methods-for-increasing-app-engagement-user-retention/}} \footnote{\url{https://www.kahuna.com/blog/stop-spamming-your-users/}} and increase revenue \footnote{\url{http://www.appcues.com/blog/why-user-onboarding-is-the-most-important-part-of-the-customer-journey-by-2.6x/}}.

\ignore{Provide a definition of user onboarding}
