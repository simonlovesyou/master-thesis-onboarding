\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}
% In the study or research design, you explain where, when, how and with whom you are going to do the research.
% The question of 'how' will determine your research method. Are you gong to conduct research using a survey or perhaps with an experiment?

The method of this study, as presented in the following sections, are based on \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item creating a basis for the framework through a theoretical framework (see Section \ref{sec:theoretical_framework}, below); and
  \item evaluating the framework (see Section \ref{sec:evaluation}, below)
\end{enumerate*}

\section{Theoretical Framework}
\label{sec:theoretical_framework}
The theoretical framework is built in two phases: \textit{Theoretical background} and \textit{Best practice evaluation}.

\begin{description}
  \item [Theoretical background] Relevant theoretical material is gathered to explain the onboarding process defined by Bradth et al. \cite{Bradt2009} in an user experience research context, with the additional material about relevant UX challenges. The material gathered is retrieved through the Google Scholar search engine and the "Digitala Vetenskapliga Arkivet" (DiVA) portal. This material is complemented with eventual articles, blogs and videos. A review of the material gathered and the conclusion of it is presented in section \ref{sec:theoretical_background}.
  \item [Best practice evaluation] The best practice evaluation is done through a competitive review \cite{Schade2013} of popular mobile applications to pinpoint the different kinds of methods used to onboard users. The apps analyzed are chosen to cover a large ground of different onboarding techniques and apps of different categories (e.g game, productivity, social). Competitive analysis is important to generate insight into the competitors' employed strategies, both past and present, and will help us give an informed basis to develop and establish strategy advantages to our competitors \cite{Wilson2010}. The review will focus on the technique used to onboard user and aspects identified in the Theoretical background. These analyses will be conducted in a similar manner to how the website "UserOnboard"\footnote{\url{http://www.useronboard.com}} perform their analyses, which is a similar method to \textit{cognitive walkthrough}. The walkthrough method consists of answering questions about each of the decision users have to make as they explore the interface. The questions should identify the users' goals, the ease of which they they can identify the consequences of their actions, and how easy it is for the users to evaluate whether they are making progress toward their goal \cite{Lewis1990}. A review of the analyses and the conclusions of it is presented in section \ref{sec:best_practice_evaluation}.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
The evaluation and verification of the framework is performed in three phases, which are explained further in the following subsections. The first phase \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item is by identifying possible onboarding pitfalls with the mobileApp through usability testing testing, and
  \item make amendments to the app with prototypes and the framework, user test the prototypes and verify the improved user onboarding.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection{Usability Testing}
The usability tests are conducted in a lab setting, where the participants are asked to perform tasks with the mobileApp.

The tests are planned after these specific steps, as defined by \cite{Dumas1999}:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item defining the goals and concerns that are driving the test
  \item deciding who should be participants
  \item recruiting participants
  \item selecting and organizing tasks to test
  \item creating task scenarios
  \item deciding how to measure usability
  \item preparing other materials for the test
  \item preparing the testing environment
  \item preparing the test team---assigning specific roles, training team members, and practicing before the test starts
  \item conducting a pilot test and making changes as needed
\end{itemize}

Each step is described below.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\label{subsubsec:goals}
The goals of the usability tests of mobileApp we identify are \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\(\arabic*\))]
  \item a general goal for the product,
  \item quantitative usability goals for the product,
  \item general concern for this test,
  \item specific concerns for this test
\end{enumerate*}, as proposed by \cite{Dumas1999}.

\subsubsection{Participants}
\label{subsubsec:participants}
The participants are chosen from the target market of mobileApp, which have not used the mobileApp before. This decision is made to more easily identify learnabilty issues with the interface as they use it for the first time. The identified characteristics of the test group follow the user profile template suggested by \cite{Dumas1999}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item General characteristization of the user population
  \item \label{enum:characteristics}Characteristics of the users that are relevant to the test
  \item Which of the characteristics that are listed in \ref{enum:characteristics} should all users in the test have in common and how will you define them?
  \item Which of the characteristics that you listed in \ref{enum:characteristics} will vary in the test and how will you define them?
\end{enumerate}

The profile is developed in collaboration with the product owner of mobileApp. The final profile can be found in Section \ref{sec:participants}.

\subsubsection{Tasks}
\label{subsubsec:tasks}

Since we cannot test every possible task users can do with the product, we have to carefully select the task they are to perform. Dumas and Redish \cite{Dumas1999} write that we should select a sample of tasks
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item ... that probe potential usability problems
  \item ... suggested from your concern and experience
  \item ... derived from other criteria
  \item ... that users will do with the product
\end{itemize}

For each identified task which is defined with the help of the developers and product owner, as suggested by \cite{Dumas1999}, we identify the time required for the task and resources needed. All tasks defined are detailed in a final list of tasks which can be found in Chapter \ref{chap:result}.

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
The tasks identified in section \ref{subsubsec:tasks} are formulated to the test participants as \textit{scenarios}. Scenarios describe the task in the user's --- not the product's --- words in an unambiguous way. A good scenario is directly linked to your tasks and concern, and gives the user's enough information to complete the task. The participants where asked to think out loud when performing the scenarios, and depending on the participants ability to do so the test leader might probe the user with questions about how they think and why/how they performed an action.

\subsubsection{Measurements}
\label{subsubsec:measurements}
While performing the usability test we've collected both performance measures --- counts of actions and observed behaviors --- and subjective measures --- people's perceptions, opinions and judgments --- as \cite{Dumas1999} suggest.
The performance measures are directly related to the concerns and usability goals that we define for this particular usability test, as \cite{Dumas1999} suggest. Performance measures are identified based on the test supervisors jugdment.

For collecting subjective measures a post-test survey is conducted with the test participant, where the post-survey include questions about their perceived ease of learning the product, ease of doing a particular task etc.

\subsection{Prototypes}

\section{User Testing}
The application is tested in a lab-setting with user who have not used the application before, but are experienced with other smartphone applications. \ignore{Find a source of user testing}

\section{Prototypes}
%
Prototypes are developed with the aid of the framework to try and fix eventual problems found when user testing. These prototypes are then evaluated through a heuristic usability evaluation to validate the developed framework.
