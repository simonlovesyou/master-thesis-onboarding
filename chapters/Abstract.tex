\section*{Abstract}

Providing a good onboarding process for your mobile users can severely reduce abandonment rate and increase company revenue. But doing so is hard; there are a lot of aspects (e.g. motivation, the context of use, target user, interface design) that has to be considered. This goal of this thesis was to create a general design framework that can be used by designers and developers as a foundation when designing their onboarding experience.

The framework presented in this thesis is based on a vast theoretical framework from fields such as cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, interaction design research, industry practices and more. A prototype for the onboarding experience of mobileapp was developed with the aid of the framework, and a significant positive difference in perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness after they had used the prototype was observed. It is not clear from the results, however, if this improvement is due to the onboarding framework alone.
