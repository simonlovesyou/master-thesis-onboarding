  Annote = { When the authors are presenting the topic of onboarding and MOOCs there are a lot of unreferenced claims about the importance of the topic. When presenting the different elements of onboarding the authors mix competitor analysis with unreferenced claims about best practices. The methodology of the paper is hard to define; the authors evaluate 6 major MOOC providers without discussing how they analyse them, and make claims that none of the tested MOOC providers have a "smooth" onboarding experience. The suggested improvements to the onboarding process does not target specific problems they have found in the analysis, instead they target larger onboarding concepts. The study has not been an objective one; most of their claims about best practices are unsupported. Their "insights" about the users of MOOCs are unsupported and the language and spelling errors does not persuave the reader. The final value for the reader are some of the targeted areas, that still require additional references and sources, and that providing a good onboarding user experience is difficult. }

  Annote = { The paper does not properly introduce the concept of plan recognition systems to the reader, but does present the problems inherited with these kind of systems. The paper introduce a non-cooperative generic method that can be used to enhance the performance and accuracy of any plan recognizer. The findings of the paper may help us suggest and/or test a method to define the user's plan when using an application. }
